The Chronology of Water,4.5,"AFI 2025: film #17
'before i hated him, i loved him'
the older i get, the more trauma i collect, the more grief i experience, the more i find myself haunted. memories slap me in the face out of left field, and one particularly sinister bad dream can ruin my whole day upon waking. the memories stack up in my mind, pushing old ones out to take up space, infecting my cranium like a virus that’ll never shake loose. and no matter how well i'm doing and how happy i am in life, these ghosts live with me now, unpacking their bags and settling down, and every day i adjust to their presence
all that to say, this surprised the fuck out of me. viscerally raw, like cracking open the subconscious like an egg just to see what pours out. the only thing i can think to compare it to cinematically is the work of lynne ramsay, my favorite director, and i don't make that comparison lightly. which definitely helps explain why this worked so well for me: the editing is organically erratic, splicing like it wants to wound. the sound design cracks like a whip, unyielding and intuitive. imogen poots throws down an unbelievable performance, oozing with pure electricity on gritty 16mm, tying the whole thing together with the kind of talent you always hope to find in a movie like this but rarely come across
and my first thought when it ended? that i'm not sure if i can ever watch this again. it's brilliant but deeply unpleasant. i often find no issue in revisiting uncomfortable films, as well as waving away ones that dwell too heavily in the morbidity and lack real worth. but this lays snugly somewhere in between, something i'm so glad i got to experience but need at least some time to digest. might read the book in the meantime. so yeah. super chill film, what a breezy watch",TRUE,0.09,0.743,0.167,0.9695,the chronology of water,the chronology of water,tt8667404,The Chronology of Water,The Chronology of Water,the chronology of water,"Biography, Drama, Romance","An Olympic swimming hopeful flees her abusive home via a Texas scholarship.

what magic, conjured up and bottled. conceptually it's maybe the most accessible of kaufman's museum of cinematic oddities that i've seen, and emotionally solid to the core, managing to worm its way into the hearts of millions over the years. i thought i might not cry, and then clem starts to fade away, the two of them finally meeting for the first time and saying goodbye all at once. a packed house with many people sniffling loudly after the lights came up, and plenty of people crowding the sink in the women's room using wet paper towels to wipe away tear stains
i think what got to me, to get personal for a moment, is just how much my dreams nowadays blur the lines of reality and memory. having lost my mother a decade ago, and my brother almost a year ago, and more than a few beloved pets in between, i close my eyes every night and sometimes happen upon them, waiting to greet me, or haunt me. they show up, and my mind knows somewhere that they're gone, they're not coming back. that weird ache, that sensation of loss. and sometimes we speak about it, or i ask about it. why are you here? where did you go? how are you back? this isn't right, it's all wrong. memory is the most commonplace ghost on earth, and when memories shape my dreams it can make or break my day when i open my eyes
grief is a part of life and this film beautifully encapsulates grieving those who are still meandering around somewhere, trying not to think of us as we try not to think of them. loss in any form is profound, but it was cathartic for me to revisit such a film with new memories and losses of my own, many lives into the one i've got
i don't want to jinx it, but i've really been falling back in love with movies these days. really hoping i don't fuck it up",TRUE,0.082,0.791,0.127,0.9839,eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,tt0338013,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi","When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to have each other erased from their memories forever.",,,,

this remains one of the most impactful films i’ve yet to see in my life. i just turned 30, and most of my days so far i’ve spent isolated from other disabled people, surrounded by able bodied peers, trying to keep up in my wheelchair. trying, and often failing, to match their work ethic, energy levels, social lives. it is a high bar to set for myself, but it’s all i’ve known
at this event i was overwhelmed by solidarity, hearing disabled creative professionals discuss the industry and how vital it is that we continue to kick the doors down to participate, to be seen, to be heard, to be present both in front of and behind the camera

Poor Things,4.5,"a cinematic feast. there are a handful of small lulls in the second act, but as a complete picture it devours. the absurdity and tragedy of living boiled down to a rich concentrate and then spray painted all over the walls. i’m craving that rewatch already
gotta be a career best for emma stone, and i don’t say that lightly. her character progression is so intuitive that it’s sometimes almost difficult to watch. human nature captured in facial expressions and body language, the kind of performance that some have attempted but i doubt anyone has pulled off quite like this. and the way the score accompanies her journey, starting with single notes plunking carelessly, eventually finding their footing and growing wilder and more complex with purpose
and i’m trying to avoid sharing any possible spoilers here because i think going in colder will probably be a richer experience, but i do have to say that the cut from black and white to color is an all timer for me. all things considered, this is probably yorgos’s most heartwarming and hopeful film to date. what a delicacy",TRUE,0.089,0.76,0.151,0.9521,poor things,poor things,tt14230458,Poor Things,Poor Things,poor things,"Comedy, Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi","An account of the fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter, a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter.",,,,

i’ve read some reviews wishing that the final act packed a bit more of a punch, and while i understand the let down, i personally disagree. it felt fitting to see a character so privileged and vain doing such unspeakable things in an effort to garner attention from others and it falls flat. and it’s so interesting to sympathize with her when she’s suffering, but recoil upon remembering that the suffering is of her own creation. such a twisted experience",TRUE,0.144,0.665,0.191,0.8706,sick of myself,,,,,,,,,,,

feels like i’ve been thinking about this daily and singing about it from the rooftops since sundance earlier this year, so of course i leapt at the chance to rewatch. while i still don’t think it’s perfect, (and still definitely not for everyone), i’m glad to discover that it did hold up as a striking film and a fantastic debut for both the director and lead star. i’m kind of awed by how much plot is tightly wound into the framework, and by the ending it all comes full circle in both bad ways and good. but the perspective might be what i still like the most, every scene that’s difficult to watch has a purpose and stays firmly planted in the shoes of the lead and is never graphic just for the sake of it. and solidifying my feelings during the q&a was such a nice change of pace after some of the frustrating movie experiences i’ve been having lately. and the soundtrack!!! i could keep saying things blah blah i like movie but basically i think this one is very interesting and relevant and super fucking cool. skål",TRUE,0.061,0.78,0.159,0.9711,pleasure,pleasure,tt13520940,Pleasure,Pleasure,pleasure,Sport,"Slamming into concrete walls, risking the backcountry unknown, being broke on the road...

celine is so incredibly good at naturally fitting emotion into such a neat and minimalist package, and the catharsis in experiencing what she’s made is like unwrapping a present from someone who loves you. yes it’s super cute and sweet just like i anticipated but really resonated with me in a deeper way. i can already feel my love for this blooming inside my chest",TRUE,0,0.726,0.274,0.9647,petite maman,petite maman,tt13204490,Petite Maman,Petite maman,petite maman,"Drama, Fantasy",Nelly has just lost her grandmother and is helping her parents clean out her mother's childhood home.

“i always overdo it”
had high hopes for this and it held up for a while, especially in its humor, but i’m not really sure what i’m supposed to take away from it in the end. the protagonist starts out pretty fully formed but then the writing begins to disintegrate and chip away at her until she’s left a manic pixie shell of her former self, but maybe that’s what she was all along on paper and i just didn’t see it. either way i do wish this was more about her and less about her relationships, the drama becoming tedious and by the last act totally lost me when it was supposed to be emotional or whatever. damn",TRUE,0.07,0.833,0.097,0.3867,the worst person in the world,,,,,,,,,,,

Margaret,4.5,"a grueling but unexpected look at how trauma can inspire extreme waves of selflessness and selfishness. maybe it’s about this, and many other things too, making clear philosophical arguments while also leaving so much room for interpretation that its trajectory is often skating on the edge of aimless discomfort. a coming of age story so crushingly intimate until it pulls back and reveals how insignificant coming of age actually is. often lisa is the focus of a scene but the sounds happening around her drown her out completely as if she didn’t matter to begin with
after it ended i realized that in scope it feels like a kaufman film with a more subtle approach to its subject matter by letting the grand ideas speak for themselves (and if they do at all really depends on the viewer). it even suggests a kieślowski influence by intertwining an overall sense of responsibility to the people around us to tread carefully and choose our words more wisely. i vaguely recall putting this on some time in the past decade and not really understanding what it was going for, and now i feel mostly the opposite. neither opinion is really right or wrong because i think they coexist here and in this instance make sense. it feels like it’s about nothing and everything all at once, and maybe that’s why i liked it so much
this has one of the most interesting protagonists i’ve seen in a long time. she’s a lot to stomach, think lady bird but with even less emotional control. in a way it’s infuriating and the performance can even seem aggressively over the top, but in hindsight this might be anna paquin’s best role to date and proves how wildly talented she really is. here she plays someone who already doesn’t know how to truly relate to anyone or show emotion in healthy ways, and then early in the film experiences trauma so quickly and severely that it shapes her whole existence, at least for a little while. she lets her feelings tumble out violently and chooses her words recklessly in nearly every conversation, crying out for emotional support that she won’t accept and begging for solutions that don’t exist
if communication is key then this film is an uncrackable lock. being misunderstood is so singularly frustrating, and even more so when grieving or trying to make sense of senseless everyday horrors. the genius of putting a self absorbed (but good hearted) teenager at the center of this moral epic cannot be understated as it puts every moment into perfect perspective, especially in new york city of all places. it suggests that the pain and suffering we’re experiencing can simultaneously be the most important and least important thing in the world, however dramatic that may seem. we exist inside of our own heads and bodies alone but can’t forget that everyone else does too. and that’s one of the great beauties and tragedies of life

Nomadland,4.5,"best picture marathon: film #8
“because she loved rocks”
this truly feels less like a movie and more like a fond but hazy memory, which might be why it’s so special in my eyes. life is mostly made up of memories we recount all alone in the quiet, and otherwise we’re busy distracting ourselves to keep from thinking about them. this honors those memories and gives itself over to a protagonist who chooses to live inside of them while on her journey. always choosing to wear its heart proudly on its sleeve, this is simply a story about people doing their best to get by in a way that also makes them feel happy and free. chloé zhao captured and created absolute magic with this one and i think it deserves all the love it’s receiving",TRUE,0.029,0.657,0.314,0.995,nomadland,nomadland,tt9770150,Nomadland,Nomadland,nomadland,Drama,"A woman in her sixties, after losing everything in the Great Recession, embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad.",,,,
Sound of Metal,4.5,"best picture marathon: film #7
“you saved my life. you made it beautiful”
i’ve seen many films tackle the subject of change, but never quite like this. the narrative here unfolds more like reality, the lead character riding waves of distress alongside occasional moments of joy and acceptance as he struggles to decide his next move. life is not a straight line, it’s messy and unpredictable and fucking scary, and this paints that picture in a really balanced way. and it’s pretty remarkable when a film can center itself firmly on both a character and that character’s most vital relationship, but this makes it look easy. there’s a small moment where olivia cooke’s character stares at the protagonist as he struggles with his new reality, and the pain she feels with him and for him is clear as day. this is such a heart wrenching film, but it also emphasizes finding stillness wherever you are and amidst whatever life is throwing at you. and that is just superb",TRUE,0.128,0.663,0.209,0.9638,sound of metal,sound of metal,tt5363618,Sound of Metal,Sound of Metal,sound of metal,"Drama, Music","During a series of adrenaline-fueled gigs, itinerant punk-metal drummer Ruben begins to experience hearing loss.

“anywhere there's people, there's power”
always keeps our focus right where it needs to be and in turn the emotional weight of every scene feels just as heavy as intended. just phenomenal filmmaking with amazing performances all around that never feel overzealous or phoned in. daniel is my personal choice for best supporting (the way he speaks softly to his loved ones is just as impressive as the way he commands a room of hundreds) but lakeith is just as good (lakeith is always good). i do have to say that my favorite performance is still dominique fishback who was absolutely devastating but still perfectly composed from scene to scene (snubbed, snubbed, snuuuuuubbed!). it felt a little long upon rewatch but that might have just been my exhaustion instead of the film’s pacing. overall this really is a must see",TRUE,0.098,0.719,0.184,0.9118,judas and the black messiah,judas and the black messiah,tt9784798,Judas and the Black Messiah,Judas and the Black Messiah,judas and the black messiah,"Biography, Drama, History","Offered a plea deal by the FBI, William O'Neal infiltrates the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party to gather intelligence on Chairman Fred Hampton.",,,,

“i’ve never been on trial for my thoughts before”
the biggest piece of oscar bait in the bunch, but i was expecting that all along. it has its moments of triumph when the music swells and i’m momentarily won over, but otherwise this is just too much courtroom and isn’t worth the runtime. sorkin scripts are usually overwhelming at times but this one is especially wordy and feels needlessly distracting, like we get it, you’re a screenwriter. and he clearly isn’t the strongest director which makes this uninteresting as a whole. i will say the actors do a pretty impressive job with the material given, but i just know that i’ll be forgetting about this the second the oscars are over",TRUE,0.018,0.761,0.22,0.9858,the trial of the chicago 7,the trial of the chicago 7,tt1070874,The Trial of the Chicago 7,The Trial of the Chicago 7,the trial of the chicago 7,"Drama, History, Thriller","The story of 7 people on trial stemming from various charges surrounding the uprising at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.",,,,
Promising Young Woman,1,"best picture marathon: film #4
“you’re right, ok? is that what you wanna hear?”
i’m of the opinion that this is an irresponsible movie. it doesn’t really matter to me if i think it’s well made or piss poor, because in the end it just stings with that carelessness. for months i’ve been weighing it on my tongue and mulling it over, and i’ve realized that it only tastes worse every day. and upon rewatch i discovered that i can’t even accept it as a study of grief or self sabotage in the wake of loss when the ending is just too much to stomach. at one point i thought it would work better as a flat out horror movie, at least then its mixed messages would likely operate better within that genre. but here it’s just a glitzy mess, too obsessed with drilling the point home that it completely collapses in on itself
it feels like the only intention here is to shame the audience over and over again, and in response to feeling that shame many voters in various spaces have gifted it with a slew of nominations, including at the academy awards. i’m not really saying it doesn’t deserve the nominations, (or even the awards), but in a nutshell this feels to me like the most easily digestible ‘me too’ movie yet, more aggressive and well directed than bombshell but with still no real statement to make, both vague and flashy simultaneously so that the final credits rolling are supposed to inspire shock and awe. but it honestly just makes me feel uncomfortable. it tries and has its moments but is overall unable to charm me, and i doubt it ever will as i have no intention of revisiting this any time soon
i’m gonna end this like i ended my last review of this movie, with recommendations: if you’d like a 2020 movie that handles this subject matter with more subtle grace then i highly recommend the assistant. or if bloody revenge is more your thing, revenge (2017) is definitely worth a watch. for b-movie horror similar to this i’d check out american mary. and finally the series i may destroy you, which i haven’t been brave enough to watch myself yet but have only heard stellar things about and plan to watch soon. i just don’t recommend this, that much i know for sure, and it really bums me out",TRUE,0.148,0.69,0.162,0.8457,promising young woman,promising young woman,tt9620292,Promising Young Woman,Promising Young Woman,promising young woman,"Crime, Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Nothing in Cassie's life is what it appears to be - she's wickedly smart, tantalizingly cunning, and she's living a secret double life.

Zack Snyder’s Justice League,4,"the interesting thing about snyder is that he always swings big: whether it results in a colossal whiff or a home run just depends on the particular project, amount of creative control, and audience reception. but he always puts his unique style into it, and for that reason i’ve really grown fond of his stuff. his involvement in the dceu has kept me interested, and i still have fun with both their best content or biggest flops. too often nowadays blockbusters, and especially franchise films, fall completely in the middleground and feel a bit too safe creatively, and the effect makes me feel empty and bored. the mcu is guilty of this, and the original cut of justice league suffers as well because of joss being brought in to finish it
comparing the original version to this is like day and night. some of the bones are still here, but the editing has completely changed the DNA: for instance, a heroically cheesy early scene featuring wonder woman and some bad guys has become grim and purposeful here, reminiscent of the dark knight’s thrilling opening sequence. and with the extra hours allotted there is plenty of time for world building both big and small. more backstories, mythology and villainry are packed in to be sure, but i especially loved that even the side characters get to experience their emotional moments of truth. my favorite aspect of this cut might be the league itself and how the dynamics have changed: the first version relies too heavily on humor and it feels forced, the connections never fully occur and it rings hollow. but here they take each other seriously and grow a camaraderie and respect, at first having trouble getting into the group mindset but eventually working together seamlessly. they look out for each other and work towards a common goal, and when the humor does come out between them it feels organic and earned.
to wrap it up i have to admit that i’m just happy it exists. this is the justice league i was hoping for before the original came out, and while it’s still far from perfect it successfully satisfied me and even left me wanting more. it drops the bright and glossy hollywood shine and in turn loses most of the resemblance to its former self, fully morphing into a desaturated snydery melodrama: and i’m fully on board. it also casts an overall spell in a way that these films usually can’t quite pull off, both grimly atmospheric and monumental, reminding me more of lord of the rings than any superhero movie i can recall. if you don’t like superhero stuff, the dceu or snyder i’d tread lightly, then again you might be surprised. but i love these characters and i’m glad they got this moment to shine. and personally speaking i think these four hours do a better job than the avengers did with four movies. and cinematically speaking it’s definitely the winner as well",TRUE,0.073,0.692,0.235,0.9987,zack snyder s justice league,zack snyder s justice league,tt12361974,Zack Snyder's Justice League,Zack Snyder's Justice League,zack snyder s justice league,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","Determined to ensure that Superman's ultimate sacrifice wasn't in vain, Bruce Wayne recruits a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions.",,,,

“you won’t find anyone like me”
i’m completely floored. i’ve been terrified of watching this the entire festival, fearing the worst, and while this is an extremely difficult watch in terms of both sex and sexual assault/violence i never once felt that we weren’t supposed to have empathy for the protagonist in those situations. sofia kappel (in her first acting role ever) is magnetic and perfectly cast, and behind the camera ninja thyberg masterfully maps out every scene. together they made this intense as wildfire, both beautiful and dangerous, something that i couldn’t tear my eyes away from even when they began to water and burn
the unflinching look at the sex industry is deeply unsettling but also normalizes it for women in a way that i haven’t seen properly portrayed in such a film before. it shows situations with high professionalism where consent and respect are key, and then flips the script to address the pressures of being the only woman on a risky set that takes a horrifying turn. the balanced perspective keeps this realistic as we follow the lead from quiet daily routines to glamorous slow motion photoshoots. it explores broad themes like ambition, friendship, trauma and power while also making it clear that the industry has plenty of toxic sexism and racism at its core. the protagonist chooses this path for herself and we witness her contemplative moments of doubt and fear, but she controls her life and chooses it again and again. it isn’t meant to seem like a mistake or a tragedy but instead a choice. her relationships with the women around her are the most complex and interesting by far, the competition and power struggles providing one of her most intricate hurtles. one of my only problems with the film is the lack of perspective from women of color and/or trans women, this focusing on a white woman who chooses to join the glamorous and famous side of the industry instead of a woman who might have less of a choice or is much more at risk. besides that i can’t think of much else i would criticize (for now) except for how far it pushes boundaries, but without that i feel in this case like it would lose authenticity and purpose 
the second the film ended i couldn’t dive into the q&a fast enough, making it the only one of the fest i truly sought out. and watching it only solidified my fascination with the film as the director addresses different aspects of it with a clear perspective. about bella’s desire to join the sex industry, ninja said she didn’t want to psychoanalyze the character and try to delve into “what’s wrong with her”, this decision lets the protagonist choose her line of work free of prejudice from the filmmaker (and audience) standpoint. and about the choice of music (which is a mix of opera/hip-hop, all original for the movie i assume because i desperately tried to find the songs afterwards and had no luck), the director compared society viewing women singing opera to be the highest form of art, (with porn being the lowest), and wanted to merge the two, “opera is women moaning, but it’s fine art”. comments like these gave me more confidence in the film overall, the intentions behind it clearly purposeful and full of agency and respect in regards to sex work while also staying critical about the internal problems within the industry
whew, i had a lot to say about this, but it still feels like i’m only scratching the surface. this is most definitely not for everyone. it’s absolutely fucking relentless, but i also found it to be made with a deep level of respect, empathy and intelligence as well. not everyone will feel this way about it, that i already know for sure. this feels to me like a perfect example of an uncomfortable film being rewarding and artistic underneath. i hope it gets picked up so you can choose if you’d like to see it for yourself",TRUE,0.118,0.72,0.162,0.9884,pleasure,pleasure,tt27375467,Pleasure,Pleasure,pleasure,Horror,"A young woman accidentally finds pleasure through her own physical pain.

wanted to check this out for the editing and that didn’t disappoint. for something like this it’s all about the art of the edit, because good montage editing can convey love, hate, joy, despair and humanity itself, tying themes together to spark emotion. and those sequences did often give me goosebumps, but otherwise i wasn’t as invested in this or moved by it like some will be. i would love to edit something as ambitious as this one day",TRUE,0.056,0.72,0.224,0.9552,life in a day 2020,life in a day 2020,tt12706768,Life in a Day 2020,Life in a Day 2020,life in a day 2020,"Documentary, Drama",Life In A Day 2020 will call on millions of people around the world to film their lives on July 25.,,,,

what a nice way to start this festival: i can’t imagine a more pleasantly accessible way to frame a film like this. it keeps a down to earth handle on the complex subject matter with respect and self awareness while also maintaining a light touch when it comes to the genre it occupies. it’s not perfect but was surprisingly comfortable, very warm and funny and enjoyable to watch. and i cried! it’s definitely cheesy at times but i think it works in this instance, the emotional core is so solid that by the ending it totally won me over. it might also feel too safe for some people (a few scenes felt a little too glee for my taste), and strays a little sometimes when it comes to plot, but i was charmed and would be delighted if mainstream audiences embraced it. upon release i think i would recommend this to almost anyone",TRUE,0.025,0.663,0.311,0.9958,coda,coda,tt7090140,Coda,Coda,coda,"Drama, Music",A famous pianist struggling with stage fright late in his career finds inspiration with a free-spirited music critic.,,,,

But I’m a Cheerleader,5,"i’ve probably seen the original cut of this movie over a dozen times, and it’s only gotten better since the first time i stumbled upon it. but for perspective, this review is focused on the new director’s cut because (and i’m surprised to say) it kind of rules
the first thing i have to mention is the COLOR: it POPS! the original quality always felt a little lacking and never seemed to be in hd (no surprise considering the time it was made), so this remaster thankfully boasts not just overall quality and sharpness but a beautiful boost in saturation. the pinks and blues are more gorgeous than ever, as are the rest of the colors of the rainbow. i was almost distracted by it in the best way, it feels like the original vision finally coming to light
and about the director’s cut itself: there are numerous deleted scenes and even a few scene extensions. for the deleted scenes, jamie babbit said she was nervous that people would be bored if it was too long, so she cut scenes that she always loved (including but not limited to a guitar sing-a-long of megan’s “god is good, god is straight” cheer, and an informational video welcoming her to true directions. a part of me thinks that was zachary quinto’s voiceover during that bit?? i could be completely wrong!) and for the extended scenes, the director has spoken a lot before (namely in the documentary this film is not yet rated) about the mpaa initially (and unjustly) slapping an nc-17 rating on the film for a few shots in the sex scene, which i noticed here seems to be back in original form. a lot of various other scenes are extended and with all those small new pieces working together it just feels a lot more complete as a film
so with that i really recommend checking out this version, even if you’re seeing this movie for the first time. i’m a big fan of the original but this just made it even more enjoyable for me, which is something i didn’t see coming considering how minor the changes seem in scope. it’s definitely one of the only films that continues to grow on me with time, and this only helped with that",TRUE,0.048,0.746,0.205,0.9974,but i m a cheerleader,but i m a cheerleader,tt0179116,But I'm a Cheerleader,But I'm a Cheerleader,but i m a cheerleader,"Comedy, Drama, Romance",A naive teenager is sent to rehab camp when her straitlaced parents and friends suspect her of being a lesbian.,,,,

Slowly her grandfather introduces her to traditions he learned on the reserve as a boy. All seems well until Ashley finds a picture album from the attic and begins asking questions, questions that reveal a secret that threatens to tear the family apart. In the end the story is about redemptive love and the power of forgiveness woven into the traditions of First Nations culture.",,,,

my first discovery here was that newcomer kiera allen acts circles around sarah paulson. the latter is clearly the selling point, her name all over the advertising in big bold letters, “look at sarah paulson go, look at her cry, look at her scream”, fleshing out the kind of sadistic and melodramatic role that she’s best at. but seeing a real wheelchair user maneuver nightmare scenarios and experience all levels of terror was something i’ve never really experienced before. and i’m not gonna lie, it makes all the difference for me. this isn’t just joey king wearing big glasses, or kevin mchale climbing out of his prop wheelchair in a dream sequence to dance. this is someone that pushes off walls with her arms in tight spaces and rounds sharp corners on a dime. does being disabled make her a good actor? of course not, but the good news is that she is a good actor. the whole movie rests solely on kiera allen’s shoulders, and she carries it boldly and independently while sarah pounds on the door outside

Berthelda, daughter of a fisherman and his devoted wife, has been stolen by the mermaids one day when the child is playing on the sands. Queen Unda rules that little Berthelda shall be left to roam in the Enchanted Forest, because her parents have taken fishes from the ocean, greatly to the annoyance of Unda and Neptune. Undine's mother has committed sin with a mortal and to atone for this her little baby, Undine, is taken to the shore near the fisherman's cottage, to be discovered by the fisherman and his wife. It is Undine's mission on earth to marry a mortal, and thus atone for the sins committed by her mother in loving a handsome young huntsman, whose untimely death likewise robs Undine's mother of her own life. Undine is welcomed by the fisherman and his wife, who consider she has been sent by the gods to take the place of their little Berthelda. Fifteen years pass. Berthelda has been adopted by the Duke and Duchess and among those who pay her court at the Castle is Huldbrand, the bravest of knights. To test his love, Berthelda sends Huldbrand into the Enchanted Forest and bids him return with proof that he had explored its wonders. Coming to the fisherman's cottage, Huldbrand meets Undine, immediately falls in love with her and they are married by a shipwrecked priest, whom Undine has rescued from the sea. Going with his bride to the Castle, there is great rejoicing.

Her autobiography The Story of My Life and its dramatic adaptation The Miracle Worker made Keller's name a household word. John Gianvito's new film Her Socialist Smile is a spare, pure, and beautifully composed account of her political life as a supporter of progressive causes. Incorporating footage of her home life, her surroundings, and her teacher Anne Sullivan, the film's focal point shifts to Keller's own words-her many speeches-as she ardently advocates on behalf of the causes in which she so firmly believed.",,,,

“facing the universe makes you feel so very small”
there’s something sadly romantic about spending time alone. many of us do it every day, quietly shuffling around in an art museum, or falling asleep on a train. we learn at the beginning of the film that our protagonist just went through a breakup, but it isn’t spoken about again. instead we silently experience her world along with her, whether it be gazing at a treeline from a window, or taking a stroll in the park. most of it is introspective and requires patience and stillness, but i was more than happy to join in on this quiet journey. definitely my favorite of the festival so far",TRUE,0.034,0.806,0.16,0.9651,the calming,the calming,tt11646456,The Calming,The Calming,the calming,Drama,"A filmmaker is constantly on the move after recently ending a relationship.

Tenet,,"“don’t try to understand it”
very few filmmakers in the world have as much creative control as christopher nolan does on this scale, and when this ended that became abundantly clear. the reason being because this final edit is so incoherent that not only does it take research afterwards to fully figure out, but the sound mixing drowns out most of the dialogue completely. not that the dialogue is very helpful to begin with, it only added to the confusion for me in most scenes where i could even make out the words. after some reflection i think i like and kind of understand the plot, but i think the way he wrote the script (especially the dialogue) was ridiculously all over the place
i wonder if nolan has no one to tell him how incoherent this was, or he just doesn’t care and has finally reached the ultimate level of blockbuster pretentiousness that he’s been headed towards for well over a decade now. either way, i can only see two outcomes to this as a viewer in the moment: shake it off and forget about it and how needlessly convoluted it was, or dig deeper and try to understand and see if the digging is even worth it. i’m gonna do the latter, because this year has already been such a mess and deprived us all of so many movie experiences that i don’t mind putting a little extra time into just one. i’ve never been so excited to rewatch a movie with subtitles on

The story is about a stalker; the focus is on Karen, a single mother running away from everything she loves to protect what she loves most. The film opens with Karen quickly packing her bags. She drags her son Josh out of the house and along with her; he is hesitant and doesn't want to leave. Karen ends up at her parent's house where we realize she is running away from her hometown and is terribly afraid. She leaves Josh and some belongings with her parents and runs out of the house in tears. The audience soon learns there is someone stalking Karen. Wherever Karen goes Dominic follows, she tries to lead her normal life but can't because she is constantly looking over her shoulder. Throughout the film a ""voice of god"" narrative explains things one should not do if being stalked. This only adds to the tension as we watch Karen continually doing the ""wrong"" thing which makes it easier for Dominic to follow close behind. ""Stalker"" is a powerful film, both to itself and as a supportive document to defenseless women who wouldn't know what to do if they were ever being 'stalked'. The film itself is simple; it doesn't try to explode with the newest and greatest special effects or Hollywood actors. The story might be seem hard to follow, but if you pay close attention to the voice over from beginning to end you will realize there is actually a linear story. This film marked Vinit Borrison's directorial debut. It was a piece that represented the work of a writer/director/cinematographer combo and couldn't have been accomplished without the hard work and dedication of the entire cast and crew. The film was entirely funded out of pocket with countless evenings without sleep, sex, and friends for a film that is truly from the heart. For filmmakers it's a world of high-stakes and compromise but in the end it always pays off?",,,,

Bohemian Rhapsody,1,"best picture showcase: film #3
“don’t you see what you could be?”
the only allure here for me is that queen’s music is pretty good, and it also acts as the glue that haphazardly holds it all together. the first time i saw it i was charmed by the musical scenes (and also had no idea about the numerous controversies the film has surrounding it like a wasp hive), but over time i realized this has almost nothing else of value or substance to offer: the dialogue is cheap and fake, the plot is so poorly paced and the editing is incredibly embarrassing when focused in on. you can easily guess that members of queen had a part to play behind the scenes, because at times it comes off so trite that it’s a borderline parody. and it feels like a disservice to freddie in almost every way, many of the choices made leave a bad taste in my mouth
overall my personal opinion now has to be that the musical performances tricked the masses (perhaps including myself) into believing this was something special, when a closer look reveals it to be a huge mess in almost every way. it might have been some kind of passion project for some of the people involved, but the end result still feels like such a cheap grab at a few bucks and some awards season glory that it’s almost laughable, even if it once had potential. to each their own, but i can’t imagine choosing this as a movie to adore over so many others",TRUE,0.086,0.753,0.161,0.9768,bohemian rhapsody,bohemian rhapsody,tt1727824,Bohemian Rhapsody,Bohemian Rhapsody,bohemian rhapsody,"Biography, Drama, Music","With his impeccable vocal abilities, Freddie Mercury and his rock band, Queen, achieve superstardom.

Her Smell,4.5,"“i don’t wanna see what happens next”
a claustrophobic nightmare with the volume turned all the way up until the speakers blow. in the quiet aftermath, the catharsis is strangely gratifying. chaos, regret and understanding. usually movies like this are about the rise and fall, not the other way around. elizabeth moss’s twisted monologues slide off her tongue so effortlessly that it’s almost scary, and the rest of the cast make easy work of their parts as well. this has such a unique vibe that i doubt it could ever be copied, and it seems like a daunting task to even try

The Girl in the Spider’s Web,3,"“every day you chose not to save me”
a bold statement: i think this has worth. i’m just as surprised as you might be, but when the initial annoyance wore off, i found myself caught up in what it has to offer. the david fincher version is one of my all time favorite films, so naturally it was really hard to adjust to this at first, but then i realized something: i can separate the two and see this for what it is
it was a weird decision to even go through with making this, the change is overly apparent in every frame and every brick is torn apart and rebuilt into a more standard americanized thriller rather than the chilly slow burn mystery fincher previously laid down. that one is arguably a masterpiece, but once the two are separated, this is quite a decent watch. watered down is the term i feel the most here, but fede alvarez is still a strong director all on his own. his previous two films feel stronger in style, but this is still slick and thrilling. and at it’s weakest moments, i was still entertained
compared to fincher’s film, this could very well be a slight embarrassment, but compared to many average thrillers that are churned out these days? it’s surprisingly enjoyable. imagine if they had adapted the first novel for a third time and ruined it all the more. instead this is kind of its own animal. and i like that",TRUE,0.087,0.75,0.164,0.9723,the girl in the spider s web,the girl in the spider s web,tt5177088,The Girl in the Spider's Web,The Girl in the Spider's Web,the girl in the spider s web,"Action, Adventure, Crime, Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Hacker Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist find themselves caught in a web of spies, cybercriminals, and corrupt government officials.",,,,

i’ve been avoiding reviewing this for days. don’t get me wrong, at first i was enjoying this on the surface, but underneath, i found it dry and lifeless. the only source of true energy is what the kids bring to the table and the natural chemistry they bounce around during a scene. otherwise, it fell completely flat. the throwback style of the grainy and colorless variety gets old fast. the plot is non-existent and the dialogue mostly made me wince
but the ugliest part is how it lacks direction after the first few scenes try to entice: what clearly tries to be an honest portrayal of a young boy (that shows only truth, free from judgement) turns into a cautionary tale fast. at certain points this is sloppy and unpleasant to watch, the highest highs (friendship! and skateboarding!) never outweighing the lowest lows. and our protagonist is never really treated with true care, only mishandled and thrown into every situation to either sink or swim. it doesn’t feel like realism to me, it feels irresponsible. masculinity is a hell of a drug",TRUE,0.106,0.692,0.202,0.9724,mid90s,mid90s,tt5613484,Mid90s,Mid90s,mid90s,"Comedy, Drama","Follows Stevie, a thirteen-year-old in 1990s-era Los Angeles who spends his summer navigating between his troubled home life and a group of new friends that he meets at a Motor Avenue skate shop.",,,,

“because i will not lie. that is love”
this killed me just like everyone knew it would. everything here is near perfect, and the power plays are absolutely ridiculous. the whole audience was laughing wildly during almost every scene. and it’s rare for me to thoroughly enjoy all lead characters in a film, but the three actresses really get to stretch their legs in these roles: i’ve never loved (and hated) emma stone more, and rachel weisz is brilliant as usual. and olivia colman brought emotional depth to what could have been such a dull one-note character. the combination of any or all of them had me on the edge of my seat for every single scene
hilarious and genuinely captivating, it just gets sillier until it doesn’t anymore. and it wasn’t until the end that yorgos pulled another lobster on me: i thought i was just having a good time, but without realizing it, i got sucked into a kind of love story. that’s what really drove the movie home for me, how connected i suddenly felt to the characters near the end. i was on the brink of crying and that feeling just snuck up on me and stayed

this felt like a horror movie. at first told with some interesting and even entertaining editing and music choices that keeps the pace flowing nicely, eventually that gimmick drops off and we’re left staring right at the dark subject matter. and there’s no looking away
this is the kind of movie i struggle with rating, because i can tell it was made with good intentions and everyone involved comes from a good place, but watching this felt too unnecessarily uncomfortable. that’s definitely the point, and i absolutely respect that it’s completely a true story adapted for the screen, but something about the way they handle this makes me feel uneasy. the only thing i can logically connect it to is something joel edgerton said at the q&a: that this movie was made more for the parents that strugge to accept their gay child than the actual child. he didn’t say it exactly like that, but i don’t like the intention there. i can’t really explain it in words right now, but if you see the movie for yourself, maybe you’ll understand",TRUE,0.056,0.788,0.156,0.9648,boy erased,boy erased,tt7008872,Boy Erased,Boy Erased,boy erased,"Biography, Drama",The son of a Baptist preacher unwillingly participates in a church-supported gay conversion program after being forcibly outed to his parents.,,,,

Cold War,4,"CIFF 2018: film #4
“i’ve been waiting for you”
a far more engrossing love story than i was expecting. the kind of sickening love between two people who often can’t stand to be together, but  can’t bare to live apart. there’s no real happy, no real answer to their problem. the fleeting excitement of reuniting time after time is the height of their long shared journey, and the rest is as much a mystery to us as it is to them
the final act wraps up kind of fast, but besides that, it’s an incredibly solid film. the song she sings and how it develops and changes like a theme song throughout the years really helps keep track of time: like an ever present ghost in the character’s lives, always looming a little too close. and by the time this thing ended, i realized how invested i was, and the credits felt like a punch in the gut",TRUE,0.105,0.73,0.165,0.914,cold war,cold war,tt35100801,Cold War,Cold War,cold war,Thriller,,,,,

more than anything, this film signifies the start of awards season for me. the massive hype around it, outcries that claim it’s a masterpiece. a part of me wishes i had a similar emotional reaction to it, but i didn’t feel too much of anything for the duration. the first half does give off an exciting aura (the concert scenes are captivating), but while we follow the passage of time in the film, i lost even more interest, and mostly in the characters, who felt slightly hollow. i found it hard to grow attached to them, even though the performances were maybe the strongest aspect of the film
the final act, however, loses me entirely. it’s the kind of ending you either love, or hate, or probably both. i felt nothing at all, except maybe a little contempt for it happening at all, a feeling aimed at the writing instead of the characters and their actions. it’s such an ill placed oscar bait ending to me that when my friends asked what i thought of the movie during the end credits, i wordlessly cast out an imaginary fishing pole
yet despite all my issues, lady gaga gives such a naturalistic performance, and the music isn’t bad at all. it has some truly thrilling moments and i had a good time, for a while at least. this might have left a bad taste in my mouth, but i don’t think it’s that bad of a film. and i’m glad people are feeling connected to it. sometimes that’s enough",TRUE,0.109,0.73,0.161,0.9329,a star is born,a star is born,tt10147994,A Star Is Born,A Star Is Born,a star is born,"Drama, Sci-Fi","A Star is Born is a upcoming 2022 American Drama/Sci-FI film directed by Stian A Kleveland.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone,5,"(part of the harry potter weekly double feature)
this really got me. not a lot of people know this about me anymore, but harry potter was probably the biggest pop culture influence on my childhood. 12 whole years of it. it’s a common occurrence for someone around my age, but it was such a special, sacred thing to me. after the last movie, i left the theater and knew i had to let it go. i had just turned 17, and had let the series consume my childhood since i was 5. it was a natural parting, there was nothing left of it for me to hold onto it so tightly. no more new books, no more new movies. i sobbed in a movie theater at 3am, and then said goodbye for a while. but recently i’ve been wanting to rewatch. i don’t think i’ve seen any of the movies since 2011. and then the theater i work at decided to show two of the movies each sunday for a month long
this was one of the most enjoyable experiences i’ve ever had at the theater, and i’d seen all 8 movies in theaters the first time around. i cried a lot too: harry and hagrid entering diagon alley, the hogwarts express winding it’s way through the hills. harry longingly gazing at his parents in the mirror of erised. this particular movie i used to watch every day. it was the first dvd i’ve ever owned, and i would play it on repeat on my family’s old windows 98 computer. it’s so burned into my brain that i still know every word
i’m just so happy i got to see this in theaters again, after some years of healthy distance from the biggest obsession i’ve ever had. now i can love it as an adult too, in a different way. and seeing it with my dad made it even better, because we’ve bonded over this series together every step of the way, since the night i asked him to read me the first book. maybe it’s cheesy to say now, but there will always be a place in my heart for harry potter",TRUE,0.041,0.856,0.103,0.9819,harry potter and the philosopher s stone,harry potter and the philosopher s stone,tt0241527,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,harry potter and the philosopher s stone,"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","An orphaned boy enrolls in a school of wizardry, where he learns the truth about himself, his family and the terrible evil that haunts the magical world.",,,,

Eighth Grade,4.5,"“stay cool, and i can’t wait to be you”
i’ve said it for years: loneliness is underrated. showing it on screen is really tricky territory, it’s either too dull or too dark. and in almost every coming of age film, the protagonist has a best friend, or even a big group of them, close knit and finishing each other’s sentences. but what about all the kids who didn’t have that? the ones that try for years just to make a connection, who can’t help but obsess about it. why don’t people like me? am i not trying hard enough? what could i say? what could i do? a lot of the time it isn’t anyone’s fault at all. it’s just how things are right now
this is such an eye opening experience in such a specific way. simplistically and stylistically interesting and yet leaves a lot of room to explore deeper if seen by the right person: the future and how we long for it, long to be different and better forms of ourselves. it’s a natural human feeling that we carry with us always. caught in between the past and the present, and trying to be someone that will take years to become
and visually this KILLS me, the camerawork is so effortlessly cool. so much of it is so satisfyingly pieced together. bo makes it look easy. kayla’s journey is awkward, but the film’s style is anything but. there is still one scene that really bothers me (you know the scene), and i can’t personally enjoy or fully understand it’s inclusion in the film, but i decided against writing up a few paragraphs arguing it: it feels unnecessary to me, but they tried to handle the subject carefully so i’m gonna try to let it go. for now
the real reason i love this film is that it’s a voice for the unheard. there were a lot of days in middle school that i barely spoke to anyone, and no one spoke to me either: that’s just the way it was for me then. and this reminded me that i got through it. and thank god for that",TRUE,0.071,0.791,0.139,0.9806,eighth grade,eighth grade,tt7014006,Eighth Grade,Eighth Grade,eighth grade,"Comedy, Drama",An introverted teenage girl tries to survive the last week of her disastrous eighth grade year before leaving to start high school.,,,,

During their weekly meetings, Flower's life story gradually unfolds. Anna's car becomes a safe space, a confessional booth into which Flower and others whose lives are intertwined with hers occasionally enter. This is not a story of salvation but of a profound emotional bond that reveals the cracks and strengths of human existence.",,,,

A Wrinkle in Time,2,"it means well. this has a pulsating heart, beating deep beneath miles of mess. i can feel it, the movie itself constantly reminds me it’s there, but sometimes that isn’t enough
the headlining actors make this a painless and sometimes joyful ride, and the child actors do bring charm to round out the cast, but the script is incredibly weak, and the plot is even weaker. and people claim that interstellar doesn’t make sense..... the visuals do heighten the experience, it’s clear that ava had a distinct eye for what she wanted, and she goes for it: the colors are saturated and welcoming, a lot of the camera movements are crisp and deliberate. if only they served a bigger purpose. in the end, they go to waste in this muddled wasteland of a movie
now that i have my opinion out of the way, let’s try this from a different angle: this is very obviously a family movie, a children’s movie. and while it would be ideal that all family movies have a certain universal quality to them (especially in the eyes of the filmmakers), not all of them land that mark. but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have worth. especially in this case, directed by a black woman, starring a young black girl. this means something, you’re probably tired of reading that, but it does 
and even without addressing that specifically, this is still a vision from the right set of innocent eyes. i saw this tonight with my best friend since early childhood. we went through countless shared obsessions with movies as kids, and most of those movies were just awful. at one point while watching this, i compared it in my head to sharkboy and lavagirl, and not even negatively. because we liked that movie as kids, and many others like it. because as a child, different things matter. if it strikes a chord, you’re hooked. that all consuming dedication to a movie that your parents just chuckle at, but you couldn’t love more. my friend and i even agreed that if we’d seen this together 15 years ago, we would have fallen in love with it. and we loved and respected that. and the biggest thing i took away from this, is that it’s most definitely going to be one of those movies for many kids. they don’t have letterboxd accounts, they don’t know what reviews are or how to use the rating system, but they’re going to sit in front of their tvs and click play over and over and over again, letting themselves be immersed in that special kind of childhood magic that movies bring into your life. and that’s where this movie succeeds. it has nothing to do with me, or us. it’s bigger than that. no critic or rating could ever touch that",TRUE,0.057,0.756,0.188,0.9975,a wrinkle in time,a wrinkle in time,tt1620680,A Wrinkle in Time,A Wrinkle in Time,a wrinkle in time,"Adventure, Drama, Family, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","After the disappearance of her scientist father, three peculiar beings send Meg, her brother, and her friend to space in order to find him.",,,,

simplistic and so effective. this is hands down the most proud i’ve ever been of your work, jacob. this feels like something bigger than it’s parts. the writing is solid, the storytelling is your best yet. jacob ward gives a great performance, i’m still so impressed. i absolutely loved the score, and the coloring came out so gorgeous. everything comes together and it feels really special
caring about someone is such a risk, and yet we do it every day. to let someone know you, to almost give them a part of you just to get to know them. to care so much it hurts, it tears you up. to feel physically ill. that part of you was entrusted to someone else and now it’s being crushed into dust. it’s the kind of experience we almost all have throughout our lives, and it was cathartic for me to see it shown here
jacob, i know this was a personal one for you. but i just want you to know, it paid off: this is definitely the best film you’ve ever put together. everyone involved should be proud, it’s an accomplishment in my eyes. and thank you for involving me, it means a lot to me every time i can help you with your projects even in the slightest. and thank you for the title card. advising editor has a really nice ring to it, and you know it means a lot to me. i’m really proud of you and i can’t wait to come back to LA so we can waste a whole day driving around the city in your prius listening to lorde

passion is underrated. we do what we have to, we help those around us. we do what we have to to get by. every day can be a struggle when you're living a life you don't want to. even if you don't realize that it's not what you want
finding people that share your same passions is one of the most important kinds of relationships in life. what's even more, is finding someone that doesn't share your exact passion, but will listen to what you have to say. spill your guts: gush about what you love, at length and in great detail. what do you love? why do you love it? if someone will listen, if they want to listen, even if they can't relate or don't need to know, that's an important kind of bond
i was born and raised in a town like columbus. i still live here, even though i'd love to pull a lady bird and fly away on the next flight out to some far away city. it isn't such a bad place, it just isn't where i should be right now. the last year i've grown more than i have in my life, in more ways than one. and the biggest thing i've been contemplating recently is the desire to follow what i'm passionate about. and it isn't just a place, it's people. people who share the same passion i do, people who will listen. in my case, it's film. i work at a movie theater and i discuss films all day long, with coworkers and customers, but it always feels off. like we're not on the same wavelength. that doesn't make our relationships and friendships lesser or not worthy. it just isn't the same as being around people who feel what i feel
going out into the great unknown to discover more about what you love is one of the scariest things you could do. leaving loved ones behind is one of the most heartbreaking things to even consider doing. this movie makes me cry, because the ending is a personal kind of dream of mine, and the tenderness of it is overwhelming
kogonada captures a feeling with this piece of film that is completely unique. passion, understanding, calm. this is a really special movie, but not just because of the cinematography or performances. it's special to me because it touched me. feeling that way is one of the most important feelings when watching any movie, and how you feel shapes your entire opinion of it. this truly ended up being my special movie of the year. i hope you all have one too

So great becomes the hatred between the two that when a faction of insurrectionists arises, the doctor places himself at its head and leads it against the Government. Dr. Fernandez is killed in battle. Meanwhile, the Governor's daughter Dolores suffers from somnambulism. While she is anxious to be cure, she dislikes to inform her father or her lover that she is so afflicted. Finally her old nurse makes the fact known to Zora, who possesses the hypnotic power that was her father's. Dolores submits to treatment at Zora's hands and is cured, Zora unaware that Dolores is engaged to Riques--Zora's sweetheart. When she does learn that the wedding day is set, she goes into a rage and contrives to get into the palace by night and hypnotizes Dolores. Shortly thereafter, Zora is denounced as a witch and carried away by an angry mob to be burned at the stake. Just before the torch is applied, the old nurse makes known to the Governor that his daughter has the habit of sleepwalking and is in a trance from which she cannot be roused. She also informs him that only person who can cure Dolores is Zora. At the last instant, the Governor stays the burning of Zora and promises her freedom if she will bring Dolores from her lethargic state. Zora, believing that the Governor is acting in good faith, goes to the palace and awakens Dolores. When she is found to be safe, the Governor goes back on his word and commits Zora to prison. She escapes, however, and Riques, who realizes that he loves Zora more than Dolores, runs away with her. The two are captured after a fight, and in the end Zora is put to death.",,,,

She clings to her conviction that she was the product of a loving relationship and that is why her mother called her Joy. This belief is all she has to hang onto in life. Her other activities revolve around her friend, Denise (16), who has got pregnant on purpose and is living in the home from which Joy was expelled because of bad behaviour, and her boyfriend Momo (21), a second-generation immigrant who was born and bred in Holland. Joy's search for her biological mother, have led her to an old address; on the basis of a vague physical resemblance, she assumes that the woman she finds there is her mother. She starts to follow the woman on her way to work and during shopping trips, and watches the house where she lives with her teenage daughter. Joy becomes more cheerful and more alert, and begins to develop an eye for the world around her - giving us a glimpse of the young woman she could have become if she had had a bit more luck. Then she hears someone call the woman by her name - a different name from that of her biological mother. She is profoundly shocked: her world seems to collapse around her.",,,,

titanic is, by far, the most nostalgic movie for me. it's 100% pure concentrated nostalgia. every line of dialogue and sound effect and song is burned into my brain, recalling the 50+ times i used to watch it with my mom when i was really young. she was big on movies, especially rewatching them. she rewatched her favorite movies hundreds of times, never tiring of them. she'd invite my brother and i to watch them with her whenever we were interested, no matter how young we were. she was the one who introduced me to kill bill volume 1 when i was only 10 years old and i fell in love with it. there were others we'd start to watch again and again together: selena, signs, girl interrupted, simon birch. dozens of them. she wasn't always great at spending time with me, telling me to watch tv in a different room while she watched her own tv, so movies were an easy common ground. titanic was one of the earliest and by far the biggest deal of any of the movies we watched, and that's saying something because we used to make tin hats out of aluminum foil when we watched signs.
she had the double vhs tapes, the ones i just rewatched. she'd pack them in our bags when we'd go to a chicago children's hospital hours and hours away from home so i could have surgery. she'd start the first tape every night as we settled down in the hospital room, the nurses coming in every once in a while to check on me and glancing at the tv. 'oh! titanic!' they'd say. my mom liked the volume loud. she didn't stop it or turn it down if i fell asleep, and i started to fall asleep almost immediately after it began. so the audio pierced through my dreams many times as i slept, and now it's like an echo in my head whenever i watch it.
this isn't a review as much as a memory i wanted to write out and might as well share, for anyone who cares. titanic is a great movie, but it doesn't matter to me how great it is, because it'll always be one of the purest ways i was connected to my mom. i probably haven't seen it since 2012 when we went to the theater together for the re-release. after she passed, i thought i might not be able to watch it for years, and maybe never again. but here i am. sometimes all you need is to carve out 4 hours to rewatch titanic and have a good cry. or at least i do.",TRUE,0.024,0.909,0.067,0.9586,titanic,titanic,tt0120338,Titanic,Titanic,titanic,"Drama, Romance","A seventeen-year-old aristocrat falls in love with a kind but poor artist aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S.

she had the double vhs tapes, the ones i just rewatched. she'd pack them in our bags when we'd go to a chicago children's hospital hours and hours away from home so i could have surgery. she'd start the first tape every night as we settled down in the hospital room, the nurses coming in every once in a while to check on me and glancing at the tv. 'oh! titanic!' they'd say. my mom liked the volume loud. she didn't stop it or turn it down if i fell asleep, and i started to fall asleep almost immediately after it began. so the audio pierced through my dreams many times as i slept, and now it's like an echo in my head whenever i watch it.
this isn't a review as much as a memory i wanted to write out and might as well share, for anyone who cares. titanic is a great movie, but it doesn't matter to me how great it is, because it'll always be one of the purest ways i was connected to my mom. i probably haven't seen it since 2012 when we went to the theater together for the re-release. after she passed, i thought i might not be able to watch it for years, and maybe never again. but here i am. sometimes all you need is to carve out 4 hours to rewatch titanic and have a good cry. or at least i do.",TRUE,0.024,0.909,0.067,0.9586,titanic,titanic,tt35431289,Titanic,Titanic,titanic,History,,,,,
