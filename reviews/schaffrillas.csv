Bride & Prejudice,3,#NotMyDarcy
Yuri!!! on Ice,4,(between tears) they were...born to make history (breaks out into full-on sobbing)
Aladdin,4,"(Was gonna give this a 7 but the supreme perfection of A Whole New World convinced me otherwise)
This is a really solid, enjoyable film. I'm not overly attached to the characters or story of this one, but fantastic songs, one hell of a final battle, and that goddamn amazing Robin Williams performance make this a treat to revisit."
Taylor Tomlinson: Look at You,4,*insert quote from the special here*
Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion,,Ö
The Good Dinosaur,1.5,...at least it's pretty.
Strange World,2.5,"...better than Lightyear, I guess?"

What the fuck was her problem?"
High School Musical 2,3,24 Frames of Nick is gonna kill me for this
Olaf‚Äôs Frozen Adventure,1,5 minutes in I was ready to walk out of the theater and just wait till Coco came out on DVD
Monster House,3.5,8 year old me was WRONG this movie kinda rules
Klaus,4,"A beautifully animated, heartwarming, funny, thoroughly delightful film. Even though the main character is literally just Kuzco"
Hot Fuzz,4.5,"A bit of a slow burn at times and those twat side cops are really irritating. But the payoff is beyond phenomenal; this is a fantastic, hilarious murder mystery turned action masterwork, where every line of dialogue can and will come back later in some shape or form. An step up from Shaun of the Dead in terms of tight direction and an even tighter screenplay."
The Monkey King: Uproar in Heaven,3,A bit too much dead air for my liking but I love how fluid the animation was for the time and how cool the fight scenes are. Who was that funky monkey
The World‚Äôs End,4.5,"A bit weak comedically, but it's still an incredible, subversive, witty, amazing film. The dramatic stuff here is the best in the trilogy, the stakes are easily the highest, the characters are fun and entertaining. It's a fantastic finish to one of the greatest trilogies ever made, even if it falls ever so slightly short of Hot Fuzz."
The Zone of Interest,3,"A chilling directorial achievement with some of the most purposeful sound design I've ever heard. And yet, I couldn't help but feel that the film was very one-note; deliberately so, I'm sure. Even so, the banality of evil can only sustain a horrific on-screen atmosphere for so long. I was chilled to the bone during the first half of the film and only felt that same sensation in fleeting moments during the second half (the piano scene, when the boy locks his brother in the greenhouse, etc.) I appreciate what the film was going for but I can't say it remained effective for me personally the entire way through."
Ocean‚Äôs Eleven,4,"A couple days ago I was grabbing dinner at this nice new ramen place. There I was, content with my noodles, oblivious to the world around me. Before my food arrived, I caught a few glimpses of a movie playing on the large flat-screen across from my table. Images of George Clooney and a fresh-faced Matt Damon flooded my eyeballs, and I vaguely recognized the film based on years of cultural osmosis. One of those Steven Soderbergh Ocean movies, I think? I've heard decent things about them; maybe I should check them out in a more appropriate setting than this. I'm here for ramen and nothing else.
As I enjoyed my meal, thoughts of the movie left my mind entirely. I definitely didn't catch any of the rather low audio emanating from the fairly distant TV, and my eyes were firmly averted and focused on my ramen. Yet, as it was a rather slow day for business, a couple of the server girls found themselves gathering around the TV, and i couldn't help but overhear them trying to place the name of the film itself, as well as an actor they recognized.
'Yeah, what's his name again?'
'Oh, I think that's Don Cheadle.'
My head jolted up in an instant. It couldn't be.
But lo and behold, there he was, looking younger and more spry than I had seen him in quite some time. It was the man of the hour, every hour to be precise.
Don Cheadle was in the Ocean trilogy.
How could I have never known? I hold celebratory events on Twitter in honor of his birthday every year! I quote his iconic catchphrase from the 2015 megahit Avengers Age of Ultron, 'Boom, you looking for this?' on a regular basis! I sat through that fuckass Space Jam movie to see him!
If I had known he was in a popular and acclaimed trilogy of heist movies, I would have dropped everything and watched them many years ago. How did I waste so much of my life not knowing this crucial cinematic fact?!?
So yeah I watched this movie and he was pretty good in it. I liked his silly British accent. He better be in the other two movies more though"
Ratatoing,1.5,"A dense political thriller filled with thought-provoking social commentary and an explicit critique of capitalism and monopolistic business practices.
It was unironically better than Cars 2."
Lake Michigan Monster,4,"A fascinating rewatch in a post Hundreds of Beavers world. Compared to that movie's universally appealing sense of humor, this one is so ultra specific and so niche that I can see why it only majorly took off among my circle of friends. A couple stretches are a bit dryer than I remember (looking at you, cruise ship bit) and while there are so many comedic swings that still hit home runs for me, there are a surprising number of ones that fall a bit short. I was always enamored with the low-budget wit and ingenuity of this one, but now that I've seen those same elements on a much grander scale from the same team, it's hard to justify keeping this one at the same score. But it's still great! Captain Seafield still remains one of the funniest cinematic protagonists I've ever seen, this movie inarguably has the better song compared to its successor, and don't even get me started on the damn ghost army"
The BFG,1.5,A giant gets hit in the balls
Hercules in New York,1,A hate crime against the Greek people
Better Man,3,"A little too standard music biopic-y once you look past the pretty creative monkey business, but the saving grace is how it locks the fuck in during the musical sequences. Let Michael Gracey direct a film adaptation of Pippin or something god damn"
Finding Nemo,3.5,"A lot funnier than I remember. Stunning animation, very emotional and entertaining. I'm not a huge fan of Dory or the Tank Gang and some scenes aren't as good as others. But a really good entry in the Pixar canon, even if it's not a favorite"
Boyhood,1.5,A miserable experience that thinks it's way more profound than it actually is. It has nothing to say and its only value as a film comes from the novelty of its gimmick. Watch Lady Bird or The Florida Project instead.
Soul,4,"A more intellectual and artistic take on the same concepts that Inside Out and Coco tackled. I feel like these three movies make for a pretty interesting thematic trilogy, and while I think this might be the slight weakest of the three, it's nonetheless another hit for a fairly hit-or-miss studio these days."
Anastasia: Once Upon a Time,1,A movie with an absolutely batshit premise and zero actual plot. What a winning combo!
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,1.5,"A near-inconceivable trainwreck. I went in morbidly curious if it was slightly better or worse than Crystal Skull, and instead I got something whose closest kin is Rise of Skywalker, undoing nearly everything from its controversial predecessor but forgetting to fill the gaping hole at its center with anything meaningful or worthwhile.
Boring sidekicks, buffoonish villains who teleport to wherever the plot needs them to be, a complete lack of visual style, trite dialogue outside of a single good one-liner about Poland, and an overwhelming sense of 'been there, done that' permeate this obscenely dull and overly long snoozefest. For all the anticipation that this could possibly have been the 'Logan' of the Indiana Jones series, it's a film entirely uninterested in examing him as a character for the majority of its runtime, instead being content to let us gawk at an 80-year old man going on one last trek through a Legends of the Hidden Temple set. How in the ever-loving fuck did this cost $300 million to make???
A couple decent action scenes, some very scarce emotional moments here and there, and when Antonio Banderas showed up for 5 minutes it was nice to hear the sweet sultry tones of Puss in Boots and remember what it felt like to watch a good movie. I guess it's also nice to get confirmation that a megacorporation like Disney could never recapture the magic of Spielberg, no matter how good the cover artist they hire is in theory."
The Lion King,5,A near-perfect work of art that can never be replicated. Let's hope nobody is stupid enough to try.
Edge of Tomorrow,4.5,"A phenomenal, underrated action movie. Time loops are my jam (I'm the biggest Majora's Mask fan on the planet, after all) so this movie's fun premise, coupled with great performances and solid direction makes for such an incredible moviegoing experience. More people need to see this."
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,2.5,A pretty good movie if you turn it off once they get to Peru
Arrival,3.5,"A really intriguing and well-crafted sci-fi mystery. Denis Villeneuve is such a master of his craft that it's truly astounding, and I love how this movie takes its time to establish how difficult it would be to communicate with an alien race. Amy Adams is excellent as always as well. But not every scene felt necessary to me and it kinda dragged on at some parts. Still, one of the better sci-fi films in recent years"
Bee Movie,3.5,A shitpost disguised as a film
John Wick: Chapter 2,4,"A significant improvement from the first, the action is more enticing and the story is more engaging. The two halves of this movie are kinda two different movies, and while the first half is solid enough, the second half is exhilarating and satisfying. I love how well set up the rules of this universe are, to the point where I actually said 'Oh no' out loud during a certain scene. You know the one."
Flow,4,"Aaaaaaaa I love environmental storytelling! I love when animals don't talk but convey so much character and emotion regardless! I love the found family trope!
A vast improvement over Zilbalodis's previous film in terms of style and form, I can't wait to see what he does next. If this one's playing near you then run don't walk to see it!"
Belle‚Äôs Magical World,0.5,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FUCK I HATE THIS ISJENFIDJWHDJFOENEHFIOGNEHEOFNEHEOFO43BJFOFN2BDFKEUCO4EVXPENFBXPOHRO3O2HFJ2ORO3PRHDJFPCJEFHFI
Marriage Story,4.5,"Absolutely beautiful. Stellar performances all around. Even the kid is pretty good. That argument scene? Couldn't stop crying. That scene towards the end at the pub? Sensational.
I'm not sure if some of the dialogue was quite as tight as I wanted, plus the score is a little overbearing at times (Randy Newman, man. Sigh.), but the actors easily pick up all the slack. Career-best turns from Driver and ScarJo.
Interestingly enough, a ton of people have said they found it hard to pick a side in the divorce, but I though Nicole's side was significantly stronger the whole time, and Charlie needed to be knocked down a few pegs. That's kinda what the movie felt like it was about; giving Charlie some much-needed growth as a person while Nicole gets to be the person she always wanted to be. I really cared for him by the end, and I cared for her from that first monologue with the lawyer. Great stuff.
The ending made me soft too but I think that's just cause I got Jojo Rabbit flashbacks with ScarJo and the shoelaces..."
The Secret of Kells,3,"Absolutely enchanting animation, but it feels like an unfinished beta version of Song of the Sea and Wolfwalkers. Easily Cartoon Saloon's weakest film, but not a bad start for the studio by any means."
The Last Unicorn,4,Absolutely gorgeous and powerful. Young Jeff Bridges could not voice act
Deadpool & Wolverine,2.5,Achieved my dream of seeing Matthew Macfadyen on the big screen for the first time
Goosebumps,3.5,Actually kinda fun ngl
Blended,2.5,Adam Sandler really said 'What if I made Just Go With It again'
Entergalactic,4,Add romcoms to the list of genres that are infinitely better when animated
Oliver & Company,2,"After reviewing the situation, I've come to the conclusion that I cannot stand the Oliver Twist story no matter how it's adapted"
Wake Up Dead Man,4,"After the screening there was a Q&A where Rian Johnson was asked if casting Jeremy Renner was an intentional nod to the hot sauce joke in Glass Onion. Nope, apparently Rian just really wanted to work with Jeremy Renner, then realized he already did the hot sauce gag, and said 'Ah fuck it' and cast him anyway. You KNOW this mf was on the Jeremy Renner app 24/7"
Castle in the Sky,3.5,After watching 20 Disney direct-to-DVD sequels in a row it's nice to watch a real movie instead
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,4.5,"After watching both Top Guns, I was in the mood for the quintessential dad movie. Not Spielberg's all-time best but definitely my all-time favorite of his"
Furry Nights,0.5,Ah sweet! Man-made horrors beyond my comprehension
Incredibles 2,3,"Ah yes, the original 'painfully average' movie. Upon further thought, it's way better than the other films I've given that moniker to. It's fun, has great writing and inventive action, and the score is solid. Filler nonsense and a weak plot/villain/finale really drag it down, and it has little to no emotional weight. But it's still enjoyable; if we only had to wait 2 years for this instead of 14 then I think I'd feel a lot better about it overall."
Little Nicky,1.5,All of a sudden I sure am hungry for Popeyes¬Æ delicious chicken!
The Cobbler,1,All the same problems as Click with none of the sauce
Asteroid City,3.5,All these famous actors and the one who made me lose my shit the most was Hugo from Succession

Mixed Nuts,1,Alright maybe Eight Crazy Nights wasn't that bad
Happy Gilmore,3.5,"Alright this one's really funny, I'm not made of stone"
Pink Flamingos,3.5,Alvin from Alvin and the Chipmunks has canonically watched this movie
Ratatouille,5,Always hits the spot no matter how many times I rewatch it. This is gonna be a fun video!
Rear Window,3.5,Always nice when your girlfriend takes an interest in your hobbies
Batman Returns,3.5,Am I gonna get Rio 2'd again for saying this was so much more fun than the first one
Good Burger,2.5,Am I sleep-deprived or was Ed genuinely funny
Scrooged,2,Am I still supposed to find the Scrooge character unlikeable and annoying and irredeemable 75 minutes into a 100 minute movie
Guardians of the Galaxy,4,Amazing looking water in this movie
Dolemite Is My Name,4,"An absolute blast. I had inexplicably never heard of Rudy Ray Moore or Dolemite before watching this, but I kinda want to check out everything he's ever done now. This movie is just a burst of fun and energy anchored by great performances all around, with Eddie Murphy stealing the show in every scene. Plus, as an Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt fan, Titus Burgess is always a plus.
I got tons of Disaster Artist vibes from this, but I think this film handles the whole 'movie about making another wacky movie' thing way better. It's not especially deep, but it's a feel-good ride that's sure to inspire the artist in all of us.
(Side note, on the Wikipedia page for this movie, they use a picture of Eddie Murphy from the Shrek Forever After premiere and that made me happy)"
The Incredibles,5,"An absolutely flawless, mature family drama. It genuinely feels like it was written for adults first and kids were kind of an afterthought. Animation as a medium rarely gets better than this."
The Big Sick,4.5,"An exceptionally enjoyable rom-com with solid performances from everyone involved. You can tell this was a passion project for Kumail and his wife, it comes across so strongly in this funny, heartfelt film. Ray Romano's voice is like butter in any movie he's in so there's that too"
Nanoshark,5,An indomitable defense of human creativity. You will believe a man can pee/give birth to a shark.
Mission: Impossible II,2.5,"An obvious black sheep in nearly every respect, but I'd be lying if I said that ending chase scene wasn't cool as fuck"
The Grand Budapest Hotel,5,"An utter delight of a film that I continue to revisit on a regular basis. It might actually be Wes Anderson's best movie, which is saying quite a lot."
Sunday in the Park with George,4,"And Mandy Patinkin, who played Sunday, he gave everything"
Alien: Covenant,2.5,"And the award for most predictable movie twist goes to...
As a certified Prometheus (2012) enjoyer, I felt as if this one was too cowardly to follow through on its predecessor's general tone and ideas in a lot of ways. The sole vast improvement this one offers over the previous film is David; an already great character who in this film becomes far and away the greatest non-Xenomorph antagonist to ever grace the series. Fassbender brings such fantastical and disturbing glee to the role, which makes the progression of David's maniacal God complex truly awe inspiring.
Everything else in this movie isn't.
Far and away the least interesting and most infuriatingly incompetent group of protagonists the series has ever seen. What a truly incredible feat to not even consider wearing helmets on this uncharted alien world you just found out about weeks ago. Let's all split up in this android's bizarre castle of death, why not? Oh hey, something's clearly suspicious about him! I guess I'll follow him, ALONE, to this weird egg dungeon of his. Oh, he really wants me to stick my face up against one of these things? Don't mind if I do dawg. What could possibly go wrong.
The main lady, whose name I could not possibly remember if you put a facehugger to my head, is unbearably bland when put up against the badassery of Ripley, the devotion of Shaw, or even the simple yet effective emotional core Rain brings to the table through her relationship with Andy. What's the emotional core here? She's sad that her husband James Franco died? That's great and all but we don't know him! I'm sorry I couldn't be bothered to connect with her standard, played out grief. And why was it James fucking Franco?
I don't think it's a controversial statement to say that David is far more terrifying than the Xenomorphs in this film, but that's not solely a compliment directed at him; it's really hard to overstate just how unterrified I remained from the moment I saw that first little cartoonish CGI one unconvincingly scurry across the screen. (Not a CGI hater when it's used effectively or convincingly, it just wasn't here in the slightest!) The spine birth scene was pretty gnarly, but unfortunately the movie never strived to match that level of horror again. I mean, I wasn't supposed to laugh out loud at the shower scene, was I?
The main thing that really drags this film down for me is just how incongruent the Xenomorph stuff feels next to the genuinely compelling sight of David playing God. Even with the obvious narrative connection, the titular aliens feel like an afterthought, something that we mainly need to awkwardly squeeze into the last 20 minutes in order to appease those who felt slighted by how different Prometheus was. As someone who genuinely enjoyed Prometheus, I oddly find myself having trouble picturing someone who likes both of these films in equal measure. I wouldn't call this a betrayal of what Prometheus accomplished and what it was building towards, but it certainly doesn't feel like a natural continuation. There's the obvious factors, like the sharp deviation this film makes from the implications of Prometheus's ending, but there's also a general toning down of the lofty, somewhat pretentious, hyper-religious themes found in that movie. They can still be found in Covenant here and there, but let's just say it's easy to tell that this was from a completely different writing team. Unfortunately, I find myself siding with the ambitious, grandiose, often too big for its britches script, rather than one so bland and unspecial that I can't recall a single line of dialogue that didn't come out of David's mouth a mere half hour after watching it.
Honestly I think I might prefer Alien Resurrection over this one. At least that movie knew what it wanted to be."

T√ÅR,3.5,Ashamed to admit that it took me an hour and 42 minutes to realize that was the same woman from Portrait of a Lady on Fire
Happy Feet,1.5,"Astonishingly bad. There is no story structure, the characters are either flat or annoying, random plot points and themes are piled on top of each other with no rhyme or reason, the character designs are unappealing. I thought Brave was the worst Best Animated Feature winner for sure, but leave it to this movie to prove me incredibly wrong. I can't even believe this is a real movie."
The Great Piggy Bank Robbery,4,At first this seemed pretty standard then all the mobsters showed up and I was like 'Oh yeah I get it'
Earwig and the Witch,1,At least Cars 2 had the decency to finish its story.
The Emoji Movie,1,"At one point one of the main characters says 'Ok, buzzkill', and at that moment I got down on my knees and prayed to God, thanking Him for the fact that this movie didn't release two years later.
Still better than Cars 2."
The Empire Strikes Back,5,"At the age of 7, I knew practically nothing about Star Wars. It was the Burger King kid's meal toy promotion for Revenge of the Sith that got me fascinated in all these weird aliens and robots. I got the Han Solo toy that came with a carbonite shell to put him into, and had so much fun playing with it. My dad, eager to properly introduce me to one of his favorite franchises, asked, 'Do you want to see the movie where Han gets frozen in carbonite?'
So there I was, watching my first ever Star Wars film, getting absolutely transfixed by the epic battle of Hoth, the funny robots, the cool lightsaber fights, and the sad ending made a little brighter by that pretty sun they were all staring into by the end. Immediately after it was over, I asked to see the other 5 movies. I was hooked forever.
Unbelievably, Empire Strikes Back manages to invoke the same feelings of transfixion and awe every single time I rewatch it. While it maintains the simple, pulpy, campy fun of the original to a degree, it fleshes out its cast and their relationships by putting them through constant, unrelenting hardship. The emotional toll this story takes on every one of its characters is what sets it apart as a tremendous installment of both the original trilogy, and the saga as a whole.
Much like how Revenge of the Sith belongs to Palpatine, this movie belongs to Darth Vader. His decently evil presence in the original film is cranked to the max, and his endless torment of both the rebels and his own officers that fail him makes for such a vicious, calculating antagonist. This is the movie that made him one of the greatest villains in cinematic history, and that twist completely changes the trajectory of the entire saga, while also being shocking in its own right.
Everything involving Yoda is truly magical; there's so much weight behind every one of his lines and actions once he reveals his initial ruse. Yoda paints a picture of the magnificence of the Force, and the power the great mystery holds. Every one of his scenes holds tremendous purpose, not only in teaching us more about the Force, but about Luke as well. One of the most clever touches is during his encounter with Vader in the cave. You hear the lightsaber sound, but you don't see if Luke or Vader is the one who turned it on. Then, Luke backs up, and you see that his lightsaber is the one that ignited. He failed Yoda's test by using the Force for attack rather than defense, and he does the same thing when confronted with the real Darth Vader at Cloud City. Brilliant.
My favorite scene in the film, hell, the entire Star Wars saga, is Han being frozen in carbonite. The tragedy of the moment is illustrated perfectly through Han and Leia's farewell kiss, and there's someone so mystifying about 'I love you.' 'I know.' It gives me chills every time and I can't explain why; it's simply perfect from a character perspective. And the shot of the smoke from the carbonite chamber clearing away to reveal Vader's sinister visage, as the Imperial March plays...cinema doesn't get better than this. It really doesn't.
Empire Strikes Back is THE perfect sequel, the film that changed everything for the Star Wars saga and opened it up to truly magnificent, emotionally resonant storytelling. It's hard to imagine what would've happened to the franchise had this follow-up installment not soared in the way it did, but fortunately for all of us, it did. This movie will always hold a special place in my heart for introducing me to a galaxy far, far away, but its sheer dramatic weight has firmly planted it as one of my favorite films ever made. And the odds of that fact changing are so low, they're not worth telling."

When Marnie Was There,4.5,Beautiful. Too bad Ghibli never made any more movies after this. None whatsoever.
Baby Driver,4.5,"Been riding a 5-star high with this movie for the past 5 years, but I think it's finally starting to wear off a bit as I can't really justify giving a movie with such a relatively messy screenplay a higher score than Hot Fuzz or Scott Pilgrim. Deborah's entire motives are so whack and incomprehensible, and you could cut a solid 15 minutes out of the final heist preparation to make for a much tighter narrative. And while this didn't affect the score, the combo of Elgort and Spacey makes this a really tough film to recommend nowadays.
But fucking hell if this isn't some of the coolest, tightest editing and direction I've ever seen. The people who equate this to Last Night in Soho as if they're both equal signs of Edgar Wright's deterioration as a filmmaker are, respectfully, out of their minds."

Had to rewind when he attempted to swing back inside and bonked his head because I simply couldn't believe my eyes - and in the process of doing so, I noticed that this was an hour in! This thing just flies by and does not feel its length at all, it's so engrossing!
Honestly the first one of these movies to really earn the title of the franchise. The dual meeting sequence, the sandstorm chase, the sheer down-to-the-wire nature of the finale; I can't believe they pulled this thing off. This applies to the characters and the filmmakers!

Hoffmaniada,,"Came in halfway through, but I respected what I saw enough to maybe check it all out later in the future, and you should too"
The Munsters,2,"Can someone please explain the 'I am a Lego Bat' song
What is the joke there
What does it mean
What the fuck does any of this mean
help"
Mr. Peabody & Sherman,4,Cannot believe I liked this movie as much as I did
Avatar: The Way of Water,3,Can't believe I made a whole video glazing the water in Star Wars movies when THIS movie exists. Fucking amazing looking Grade A 10/10 water here
The Sugarland Express,3,Can't believe Spielberg's first ever theatrical work was a GTA movie
Singin‚Äô in the Rain,4.5,Can't believe there are still mfs out there who hate musicals when this exists
Big Daddy,3.5,Can't believe this almost made me cry what the hell
Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe,4,Can't believe this movie finally gave Jeremy a personality trait
Shark Tale,5,"Caught this at the Music Box in Chicago. There was a drag queen dressed as Lola who introduced the film. The entire audience laughed at least 30 times, murmured excitedly when Scorsese's name appeared in the opening credits, and clapped a ton at the end. It wasn't even ironic, either. I think they all genuinely had a great time with the movie, which was weirdly beautiful to see?
Honestly, this movie isn't 'good', but it might genuinely be one of the funniest and most easily rewatchable DreamWorks movies. The voice actors weirdly all kill it and it's so uniquely flawed in a way most other bad kids movies aren't. A true original. I don't like it but I do adore it."
Encanto,4.5,"Changed my mind about the songs actually, they're bangers that get better the more I listen to them. This movie fucking rocks and it better not fade into relative obscurity."
The Hunchback of Notre Dame,4.5,"Changed my mind about this one. It deserves a 9/10 despite being an utter tonal disaster. Not just the gargoyles; the slapstick during the fight scenes is straight up embarrassing. But WOW this movie is otherwise astounding. Unbelievable songs, an unforgettable score, great characters, and the best Disney villain ever (even though I complained about him, he's still amazing for Disney) makes for one of Disney's grandest, most ambitious works.
The stage musical is still better tho"
"Synecdoche, New York",5,"Charlie Kaufman movies are really cool because they make you sob uncontrollably and regret all your life choices and also there's a silly man sleeping in the basement of a house that's on fire. That's not a good place to sleep, sillyhead!"
"Two Cars, One Night",3.5,"Charming in its simplicity, and striking from a visual perspective. A great opening act for my boy Taika"
Chicken Little,1,"Chicken Little is a lot like Evangelion if you think about it:
-Main protagonist is a loser nobody likes
-His dad hates him
-The alien invasion at the end is like the Third Impact"
Terminator Salvation,2.5,"Christian Bale randomly does his Batman voice on occasion and CGI Arnold shows up with no dick and balls. I definitely liked it less than the previous film, but the story was kind of interesting on paper and the third act was kinda cool. Definitely sauceless overall but I have yet to see a truly irredeemably awful Terminator film. Oh well, there's always next time."
Lost in Starlight,4.5,Climax was obviously the best part but that elevator kiss is also gonna stick with me for a while
Madagascar,3,"Comedy itself peaked when Melman said 'Guys, we're running out of time' with a clock stuck to his head"
American Fiction,3,"Compelling social satire plotline forced to fight for screentime with entirely disconnected, rather uninteresting family drama. Many of the ideas in the main plot come out half-baked and unexplored as a result (the musical A Strange Loop covers a lot of similar ground in a more engaging way imo). Still, strong Jeffrey Wright and Sterling K. Brown performances, and genuinely very funny. The RBG posters in the publisher lady's office was a great bit"
Pool Party Massacre,3.5,"Completely fucking awful, I had the time of my life!"
Sully,3,"Completely inaccurate, he did not listen to Evanescence once"
The Terminator,4,Contains the most necessary sex scene in all of media
Baby Assassins,3.5,"Contrary to what I expected this is NOT a movie about literal babies who happen to be assassins, what a rip off!"
Stitch! The Movie,2.5,Cool overly drawn out TV pilot I guess
Tetsuo: The Iron Man,3,Cool special effects and editing. Not really my thing tho. Great film to put on while eating
A Bucket of Blood,4,Corman thought he was sooooooo slick doing this exact same plot again with Little Shop of Horrors
Family Guy Presents: Blue Harvest,4,Couch gag genuinely one of the top 10 Family Guy jokes ever
Batman Begins,4,"Could not take Bruce Wayne seriously whenever he wore a suit, like I'm sorry that is just Patrick Bateman to me"
Sonic the Hedgehog,3,Crazy Carl's drawing SENT ME
It Ends,4.5,"Crazy fucking good. Couldn't believe how strong the acting and chemistry was, couldn't believe what a masterful tonal balance this struck between terror, quiet dread, and laughing in the face of the abyss. Favorite film I've seen at Philly Film Fest (I've only seen 4 so far, I kinda suck at this whole festival thing)"
CODA,4.5,"Crazy how such a cliche and predictable movie could be sooooooo endearing and enjoyable. Loved watching this so much, I always felt so emotionally attached and invested and it didn't feel like I was being Oscar-baited to in the slightest. Emilia Jones is going places. Loved the choir teacher in this too. Man I miss high school choir!"
Hotel Transylvania,2.5,"Crazy how unrecognizable Sandler's voice is here. Like even in Uncut Gems he sounds like himself, but here he just goes full Drac dude"
Inside Out,4,"Creativity overload, in a good way. The story isn't great and the plot holes are pretty problematic but this movie's so engaging and fun that it doesn't matter. There are so many funny, expressive, heartfelt moments and characters that make this film an absolute Joy to revisit. It's not one of Pixar's absolute best, but it's pretty close."
AJ Goes to the Dog Park,3.5,Culver's getting destroyed was the most devastating thing I've ever seen in my life
Licorice Pizza,3.5,Cute and fun but not all that special in hindsight!
Zen - Grogu and Dust Bunnies,3,Cute animation test
Up,3.5,"Cute kiddie fluff with an excellent opening and score. Take those out and ehhhhh. Don't get me wrong, Dug is really funny and it's a nice little adventure but it's not really thematically cohesive like Wall-E or Shrek 2. If people could stop calling this the greatest Pixar movie based off of the opening alone that'd be great."
Ms. Marvel,3.5,Cute! Make it a 2-hour movie next time
See How They Run,3,"Cute! Wish I liked it more, especially considering that a theatre-related mystery with Saorise Ronan quirkily jotting things down in a lil notebook sounds right up my alley, but oh well"
Spider-Man 3,5,"Cycles between one of the most compelling, devastating portraits of a morally shaken hero ever put in a comic book movie, and some of the most batshit insane structural and narrative decisions the genre has ever seen. The resulting mixture is so tantalizing, so impossible to look away from, that it honestly confounds me whenever I try to pinpoint a legitimate critical score for it. There is simply nothing like Spider-Man 3. I go into it excited for its legendary comedic moments and find myself gripped by the relationship drama that operates on a level so foreign to the modern superhero blockbuster, because how many have the gall to intentionally depict their protagonist as this relentlessly unlikable? And when you finally feel like you have a grip on the story this film is trying to tell, it will always bombard you with some new wrinkle. A convenient bout of amnesia that lasts half the film, a sudden retcon of the protagonist's entire motivation for heroism dating back two entire films, a butler who suddenly decides it's time to reveal crucial information that would have changed the trajectory of the entire trilogy had he simply relayed it earlier.
And yet, so many baffling writing decisions are matched by some deeply bold swings that went misunderstood by audiences for far too long. There are plenty of valid reasons to find fault in this film, but Bully Maguire is not one of them. It remains what it always was; an entirely appropriate turn that suits his character and does not detract from the compelling portrait of a struggling relationship that buckles under the weight of a bloated, unchecked ego.
I could never deny that Spider-Man 3 is an absurdly flawed film, and yet, it sinks its hooks in me every time I give it a rewatch thanks in equal parts to its unrivaled chaotic energy and unexpectedly crushing human storyline at its center. It is a film that genuinely means the world to me; I will never get Peter forgiving Marko or embracing Mary Jane at the end out of my head. And even when the movie isn't good, it's incredible; there is not a single frame of this film that I do not enjoy."
First Man,2.5,"Damien Chazelle is my favorite director, and his direction is the best part about this movie. But maaaaaaaan, this script does not match the brilliance of his presentation. It's exceptionally dull and I don't buy Ryan Gosling in this role, I'm sorry. Great performance from Claire Foy and some excellent sequences here and there but the screenplay really sinks this one for me."
Before Sunrise,4.5,Damn I really wanted to see that play with the cow
Once Upon a Time‚Ä¶ in Hollywood,3.5,"Damn Robin from Stranger Things made a really good life choice in this movie
Tonally alien from most of Tarantino's other works, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood plays out more like a loosely connected series of vignettes rather than a flowing narrative. Unfortunately, unlike something like Pulp Fiction, where every segment intersects in some way while the film remains entertaining throughout, this movie feels much less focused and has largely underdeveloped themes and character motivations.
Sharon Tate has nothing to do the entire movie, Cliff is difficult to sympathize with for a number of reasons, and Rick Dalton, despite having a compelling storyline, still feels largely unfocused on for a good chunk of the movie. I'd call this one of the best Leo performances, but one of the best Leo roles? Not so much, even though the pieces were there and Tarantino decided not to put them all together.
With that said, the movie is suspenseful, well acted, decently shot, and mostly entertaining throughout despite being way too long. I feel like the ending is a make-or-break aspect of the film for most people, and for me? It made it. Not only was my mouth gaping wide during THAT scene, but I think the resolution to Rick's storyline is a really clever commentary on how we perceive heroism and how much violent shit we excuse in media because we simply chalk it up to 'heroism'. It was a well set up conclusion on multiple levels.
Overall, a worthwhile film, even if it feels like Tarantino dropped the ball in various areas. It's no Pulp Fiction or Inglorious Bastards but I'd still recommend checking it out. Even if it is WAY too long."
The Breadwinner,4,Damn these Cartoon Saloon movies for being insanely good and flying under my radar for the past decade
Sing 2,3,"Damn, they finally did it! Illumination made something on par with a C-tier DreamWorks movie! ü§©ü§©ü§©"
The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea,2,Dares to address the question 'If Ursula is so good why isn't there an Ursula 2'
My Deer Friend Nokotan,3,Dares to ask 'What if the Kaguya narrator was unfunny and pointless'
Hamlet,3.5,David Tennant plays Jim Carrey playing Hamlet
Whiplash,5,"Death Battle
Terence Fletcher vs. Lydia T√°r"
Cabaret,3,"Def missing something here. Sally and Brian's relationship is just so much less interesting than the theme of escapism amidst creeping fascism, and especially the struggles of Fritz and Natalia who aren't even a footnote in the narrative by the end. The songs are great but they don't serve the typical musical purpose of advancing the plot or characters. They advance the theme very well and that's fine, but is this really a shining paragon of musical storytelling if the leading man doesn't utter a single note?
Oh well, not for me and that's fine. I've heard the stage musical is drastically different so I'll give that a watch at some point."
Juror #2,3.5,Definitely didn't make the best use of an amazing premise but hey at least it had JK Simmons for like 20 minutes!
Mad Max,4,"Definitely gives off 'we ran out of budget' vibes in the third act but overall an absurd directorial debut. The score goes insanely hard! I spent the whole movie thinking 'Well yeah, obviously Brian May of Queen would turn out something this phenomenal' and then I checked Wikipedia afterwards and it was a different Brian May"
Star Wars,4.5,"Delicious. Finally, some good fucking food.
Watching this movie with fresh eyes, without thinking about the baggage associated with the franchise nowadays, is an absolutely magical experience. The worldbuilding and unfolding mysteries are astounding. The character interactions are my favorite parts; for instance, seeing Han and Obi-Wan play off of each other is great, since their vastly different perspectives make for excellent exchanges. Everyone has great chemistry, the setting is well-defined, the campiness honestly enhances the viewing experience. Only thing I don't care for that much is Luke, he's ok here but not quite as interesting as he is in future films.
But yeah my compliments to Chef Lucas. Can't wait to see what he cooks up next"
How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies,3,Despite being a massive grandma's boy this didn't really do a whole lot for me. But I still cried at the ending tho üò¢
The Adventures of Tintin,4,Dial of Destiny who? In this house we watch the REAL Indiana Jones 5
Toy Story 2,5,"Did Al build his Toy Barn across the street from his apartment, or did he move into the apartment because it was across the street from his Toy Barn?
Which came first, the Chicken Store or the Egg-partment?"
The Grand Budapest Hotel,5,'Did he just throw my cat out the window?'
Superman,3.5,Did Lex just call Superman a groomer
Ed Wood,4.5,Didn't know Burton had this kind of movie in him. Really excellent but I was distracted by the fact that Sarah Jessica Parker simply does not have 1950s face
How to Train Your Dragon 2,3.5,"Didn't really get into this one as much, I thought the middle was significantly slow and didn't progress as masterfully as the first. Third act felt rushed in comparison. Wasn't a fan of many choices the characters made. The humor from the side characters was passable in the original but obnoxious here. And the score was a massive step down.
But hey, the main characters were still great and the emotional beats hit extremely hard, maybe even harder than the first. If it had a cleaner narrative I'd probably put it on par with the original or Shrek 2, but as is, it's still a solid sequel."
Bambi,2.5,Didn't think there was enough story content or compelling character moments to sustain a feature film sadly. If this was a short film I'd love it
Johanne Sacreblu,5,Didn't understand a word of this but hell yea brother Emilia Perez found dead in a ditch
Brother Bear,2,Disney stop turning POC into animals challenge
Eega,4,"Do NOT read a plot synopsis of this movie, just watch it. You will not be disappointed"
WALL¬∑E,4.5,Do you guys think Schaff is making a Pixar ranking
When Marnie Was There,3.5,Does NOT hold up as much on rewatch dawg. What am I supposed to be feeling during the scenes that are extremely romantic coded
Just Go with It,3,Does this movie think Jennifer Aniston being hot is a twist
The Spirit of ‚Äô43,,Donald Duck commits tax fraud
The Three Caballeros,2,"Donald is shown to be in love with women, but he's part of a trio that explicitly sings about being 'three gay caballeros'. Which is it"
Raya and the Last Dragon,2,"Don't know what I was on when I initially gave this a 6/10. This movie is BAD. The score, animation, and a couple charming side characters can't save it. Its screenplay is insufferable and loaded with countless obnoxious unfunny quips, Sisu is the most irritating character in a Disney movie since the Rosie O'Donnell monkey in Tarzan, and the message about trust is genuinely irresponsible, not to mention beaten to death in increasingly unsubtle ways. The fact that Disney had the gall to release this the same year as Encanto is the most impressive thing about it; they really wanted their own 'DreamWorks releasing both Shrek 2 and Shark Tale in 2004' moment, huh?"
Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service,4.5,Don't really have much to say. It's just cute. :)
The Color Purple,3.5,Don't really know what to say so I just wanna point out that there's a guy named Adolph Caesar in this. Like what an unfortunate name to have
Jurassic Park,4,Dope as hell movie. Would've liked more Jeff Goldblum and less stupid ass kids tho
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,1.5,"Dr. Ian Malcolm was such a better character when I knew less about him.
This is about as bad as the hardcore Crystal Skull haters say Crystal Skull is"
Daddy Daughter Trip,1.5,Dude the fact that less than 200 people have even logged this movie is funnier than any joke in the movie itself. Rob Schneider's career is COOKED man
Se7en,,"Due to an overwhelming amount of people screaming at me in the comment section whenever I dare to give a supposedly mediocre movie a higher score than Se7en, I have now removed my score for Se7en in order to cut down on spam in my comment sections. Sorry for not liking your boring cop movie that only becomes great in the last 20 minutes."
"Darkness, Light, Darkness",4,üçÜüçë
RRR,5,Easiest 5 stars I've ever given in my life
Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!,3.5,"EASY BREEZY
EASY BREEZY"
Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,4,Effortlessly charming with great characters and expressive animation. Horror parodies usually make me roll my eyes out of my skull but this one does it with such finesse and absurdity that I genuinely adore it.
Moonrise Kingdom,4,"Effortlessly charming, refreshingly small-scale ball of whimsy. It's very simple and isn't quite up to the standards of some other Wesley Anderson feature films, but it's still a delightful time"
The Bakery Girl of Monceau,1.5,Effortlessly unlikable
Oppenheimer,4.5,Einstein appears in three different moments in time in this film and in two of them he has a silly hat on. Why doesn't he have a silly hat in the third moment. Christopher Nolan explain yourself. Where is the third silly hat
Sing,2,Elton Johnny
Smurfs,1,"Emblematic of every problem with modern studio filmmaking while also feeling like it should have come out in 2005. It's incredible that executives still think there is enough cinematic potential in the fucking Smurfs to greenlight the third reboot in less than 15 years. Exactly as bad as I was expecting, I just wish it could have been worse since at least then I would have remembered it in a day's time."
Once Upon a Snowman,2,End my suffering
Bo Burnham: Make Happy,4,"Ended up writing and deleting a long-ass paragraph about how guilty and pathetic I feel for being unhappy with my moderately successful life. The bottom line is, Bo understands and conveys this feeling better than any performer I've ever seen. I can't wait to finish his back catalog of specials.
And good Lord would it kill them to make Pringles cans a little wider"
Pocahontas,2,"Equal parts boring and tasteless. Hilariously predictable. Borderline unwatchable if not for the good songs and pretty visuals. Otherwise, get this trash out of my face. How do you follow up Lion King with THIS"
How to Take a Bath,1.5,Erm what the scallop?
Slam Dunk Ernest,2.5,Ernest is described as 'the hardest working cracker in basketball' in this
Tetsuo: The Iron Man,3.5,Even epicer the second time. 3 more rewatches and I'll finally give it 5 stars
I‚Äôm Thinking of Ending Things,5,"Every single line of dialogue in this movie is entirely deliberate, a piece of an exceedingly intricate puzzle that you slowly start to piece together over the course of the film's runtime. Shockingly, at no point does it become tedious, repetitive, or boring. It's a genuine thrill to see how even the most mundane conversation can be warped into something far more important and meaningful over time.
I can't even begin to process how deeply this movie affected me. I outright sobbed at multiple intervals, even though I legitimately had no idea what was going on in the story. Many people will view this movie the same way Jake's dad views abstract art: nothing more than an empty mess devoid of any true meaning. However, I consider this unabashedly bizarre masterpiece to be one of the most profound, genius (not genus) works of art I've ever experienced.
It almost makes me want to give the musical Oklahoma another chance. Almost."
Priscilla,3.5,Every time Elvis mentioned the Colonel I got Tom Hanks ridden war flashbacks
Gremlins,3,"Every time Gizmo did literally anything I got super emotionally invested. I squealed with delight whenever he was happy, I shouted 'No no no no no no no no' every time he was scared or in pain. I would fucking die for Gizmo you have no idea"
Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace,2,"Every time I rewatch this movie, Jar Jar gets more and more unironically funny"
Poison,4.5,Everybody gangsta until Wes Anderson pulls out the shaky cam
Clueless,3.5,Everyone I watched this with erupted with applause when Wallace Shawn first appeared onscreen
Mars Express,4,"Everyone is already talking about the similarities to Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Terminator, etc. So I'm here to say the city in this is a dead ringer for the city in Xenoblade Chronicles X, which is cool as hell!"
Wish Dragon,3,"Everyone: 'You should review Wish Dragon, it's definitely not an Aladdin ripoff!'
Me: 'Ok but consider this: it definitely is'
I still liked it tho"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend,4.5,"Everything I could've hoped for and more. Unironically better than Bandersnatch. It helps that I'm a huge fan of the show already, but I feel like even if you're not, you'll still have a ton of fun with it. Give it a playthrough or five"
The Boss Baby,1,Everything I wanted it to be and more
The Pied Piper,3.5,Everything was really scary except the rats. Idk for some reason they looked very huggable
Bugonia,4,Evil movie (complementary). Plemons has never been better
Road House,2,"Extremely boring but I liked when the guy shot at the falling polar bear statue instead of just, y'know, moving out of its way"
Shakes the Clown,2.5,"Extremely boring in the first half, kinda peak in the second half"
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,4,Extremely funny bit to do a version of this musical where the best singer is Toby
How the Grinch Stole Christmas,2,Extremely not good but MAN is it a ton of fun
KPop Demon Hunters,3.5,"Extremely relatable, I too love sitting on my couch"
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,3,"Eyyy my 700th log!
One of the most fucking bizarre, structurally and tonally incoherent films in the entire MCU, but it did have some epic Sam Raimi moments here and there. Please give him more control and a better script next time"
OBEX,3.5,"Fascinating and ethereal. Albert's work has such a consistent mystical feel and this is yet another engaging entry in his body of work. It's kind of my least favorite of his, mainly due to pacing and a bit of a difficult emotional core to connect with, and yet it's still very good and unlike anything I've seen in a while visually. Albert's performance is especially staggering in this."
Happy Gilmore 2,1.5,feature length super bowl commercial
Glass Onion,4.5,"Feel like I've been in crazytown for the past month after a certain bird app event so this movie is exactly the antidote I needed. Spent a good 5 minutes having a cathartic laughing fit as the credits rolled.
Also you are NOT prepared for what Benoit Blanc's first scene in this movie is"
The Abyss,3.5,"Feels like 3 different movies piled on top of each other, but thankfully all 3 of those movies are good, so it kinda works out"
The Killer,3,Feels weird to describe a David Fincher movie about a hitman as 'cute' but that's the general vibe I'm getting. A good time
Alien: Monday,,Felt a tad empty at parts without music/sfx (having them in the ship and cutting them out in space would've made a sick contrast) but overall a staggeringly impressive fan animation! Def feels like a labor of love by all accounts. And it's freeeeeeeeeeee
Speed Racer,4,Felt like it was made by 12-year olds (non-derogatory)
Robots,3,Fender is canon trans :)
Blue Moon,4,"Finally, a movie about a guy who hates Oklahoma as much as I do"
Eyeballs in the Darkness,4,"Finally, a movie that hates cicadas as much as I do"
All Quiet on the Western Front,2.5,"Fine I guess? Well-made, I suppose? I just feel like I've gotten everything I can out of Oscar-nominated war films and I don't need to see any more"
Insomnia,4,"First 30 minutes: 'Wow this guy is really good at his job'
30 minutes in: 'Never mind'"
Belle,4.5,"First of all, I think this might be the most gorgeous animation I've ever seen in a movie? I am so jealous of everyone who got to see this in theaters.
Second, the meaningful and profound lengths this movie's narrative goes to in order to subvert expectations is just incredible. This obviously was never gonna work as a straight-up Beauty and the Beast remake, which is why I was so pleased to see this movie evoke that story's premise and imagery, only to go in a completely new and thrilling direction with it. There's definitely some clunkiness to be found in the narrative, with a lot of dots that don't seem to clearly connect at first glance, but ultimately the emotional impact conveyed through the animation, music, and well-intentioned story are too strong to deny. I almost gave this an 8/10 but I had to listen to my heart and bump it up a bit.
Third, you guys wanna join kayak club"
Smurfs: The Lost Village,1,"First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village. But the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed her. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario - It just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have reproductive organs under those little white pants. That's what's so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf. What's the point of living... if you don't have a dick?"
Last Night in Soho,2,"For a couple years now, I've considered Edgar Wright to be my favorite director, thanks in no small part to the fact that the man just couldn't seem to miss. Every one of his prior films is absolutely excellent in their own wright, and I couldn't wait to see what he could do with a straight-up horror film for a change.

...what the fuck happened?

I just found this so tasteless and vile, like, are cheap jumpscares the best way to explore this particular kind of trauma? There are so many better and more subtle ways this story could have (and HAS) been told, and it feels like this movie has nothing to add to the conversation despite insisting that it does. Its horror and social commentary both come across as trite individually, but when mixed together they just feel alarmingly heinous.

The direction and editing here are shockingly lifeless; it feels like anyone could've made this. I don't think the genre shift is a valid excuse either; Baby Driver is an action movie that still distinctly feels like Wright's handiwork. This feels genuinely amateur in places, both on its own and especially in comparison to Wright's otherwise spotless filmography.

The cast is all great in spite of how trite and stock their characters are. The early scenes in the 60's are shot with clear passion and care. And I think that's where my praises end? Overall, a stunning misfire in nearly every way and one of the biggest disappointments in recent memory. I sincerely hope Wright can course-correct from this literal and figurative nightmare of a movie."
The Master,4,For a cult leader he was pretty chill honestly
Prometheus,3.5,"For all of its famous and well-documented faults, it's impossible to deny how thematically ambitious and rich this film is as a standalone story and a piece of the larger Alien franchise. Undeniably pretentious and heavy-handed with many illogical moments to be found, but weirdly beautiful and captivating at the same time. As grand from a directorial standpoint as you would hope, with enough heart pounding sequences and existential dread to overcome my initial skepticism of how much I could really get out of a mostly Xenomorph-less Alien movie. For being one of the most divisive blockbusters of the 2010s, I definitely wasn't expecting to come out of this one on the side of its fans. I think it's pretty good! Who knew?
If I was that guy at the beginning i simply would not have drank that"
Queen Dracula,0.5,For once it's my own damn fault I watched this and not William's
Dear Dictator,1.5,For some weird reason I have a craving for Subway after watching this!
Always,1,"For the first time when working on one of these ranking videos, I found a movie so boring and bad that I straight-up couldn't finish it in one sitting. I paused it halfway through and watched The Adventures of Tintin. It takes a truly special piece of shit for me to need a palette cleanser by the halfway mark. Fuck this stupid ass creepy as hell big-budget Hallmark movie."
Ryan‚Äôs Babe,3.5,Forrest Gump if it was Canadian and good
Catch Me If You Can,4,'Frank...you're not a Lutheran?' might be the funniest line in any Spielberg movie
Bambi II,2.5,Friend Owl really out here finding hot single does in your area
The Iron Giant,3.5,"From a purely directorial standpoint, this has all the hallmarks of Brad Bird's signature genius. It's also pretty solid emotionally with some excellent animation to boot. I really wish I could join the rest of y'all in saying it's a 10/10 masterpiece, but much like HTTYD2, I just have a ton of story and character problems that piled up over time.
The villain is a horrendously embarrassing and annoying dipshit, the mother is sidelined incredibly hard, the beatnik guy is incredibly hard to pin down a motivation for, the fact that Hogarth starts playing with the robot immediately before the army has even left the town just reeks of contrived conflict and idiocy, I could go on.
But it's still a good movie and I still like it for all the same reasons everyone else likes it despite my problems with it k thx bye"
The Lion King,1,Fuck
Far Far Away Idol,5,Fuck it 5 stars
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War -The First Kiss That Never Ends-,4,"Fuck it I'm reading the manga, I need to know how best boy Ishigami's Christmas Eve went"
Tangled,4,Fuck that stupid bitch-ass I See the Light song for making me cry again
Surf‚Äôs Up 2: WaveMania,0.5,Fuck you you fucking piece of shit fuck fuck fuck
Judas and the Black Messiah,4.5,"Fuck, man. What else is there to say?"
Hundreds of Beavers,4.5,"Fucking incredible, no notes"
Dear Evan Hansen,1,Fucking reprehensible. It will win 10 Golden Globes
Mulan,0.5,"Fucking worthless. It strips the original film of nearly everything that made it special, but forgets to add anything worthwhile as a substitute. It is inferior to the original in literally every respect. If that's not enough, it also contains the most fucking abysmal editing I've ever seen in a major motion picture. I'm baffled that Disney considered this theater-worthy for the longest time, and doubly insulted that they have the gall to charge $30 for such an irredeemably awful pile of garbage. A new low for the Disney live-action remakes.
But at least it's better than Artemis Fowl."
Over the Hedge,3.5,"Fun fact: the animals in this movie do not, in fact, go OVER the titular hedge. They go THROUGH it. I hope someone got fired for that blunder"
Tokyo Gore Police,3,Fun for the whole family
Faust: Love of the Damned,1,Fun for the whole family!
Airheads,2.5,Fun premise but it gets old pretty quickly
Devil Story,1,Fun when the man is randomly trying to shoot the horse. Awful otherwise
Remember Me,1.5,Funniest ending of all time. I got nothing out of anything else that happened
Mad Max 2,4.5,Fury Road may be better but does that movie have a helicopter guy? I didn't think so
Saturday Night,3.5,"Gabriel LaBelle is so damn electric in this!! So glad he wasn't a one-hit wonder after Fabelmans, he's the glue that holds this together. Little too self-congratulatory at times, little too inauthentic, and I would never feel an ounce of empathy for Chevy Chase no matter how hard a movie makes me try, but after a while I really got into the chaotic theater kid energy this movie radiates. I'd like that kid who played Billy Crystal to be in more stuff too!"
"Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2",3,Garbage Day is 10 times funnier when you know the context
Revue Starlight,3.5,Gay people gay people gay people gay people gay people
Revue Starlight: The Movie,3,"Gay people gay people gay people
(Translation: While this movie outdoes the show in terms of visual spectacle, I had a much more difficult time following the story and getting emotionally invested in the characters' plights; the surreal and often confusing nature of the story suited an episodic format much better than a film, and the pacing unfortunately suffered with a ho-hum first act that could have used some of the revues they saved for later. It's a suitable enough companion piece to the series and it's sure to satisfy its most diehard fans [Jess really loved it and that's all that matters] but it wasn't quite as enjoyable for me as it was for others.)
That Fury Road reference was fucking sick tho"
Nukie,1,Genuinely so awful that I started crying at the end. Highly recommend
Elvis,2,Genuinely unbearable! Austin Butler innocent tho
VeggieTales: God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!,3,Genuinely wonder if Pa Grape murdered his entire family considering how we never see them again after this
Bumblebee,3,Gets worse the longer it goes on but it's mostly really charming and cute. John Cena's line about the Decepticons' name made me belly laugh cause that's exactly what I was thinking
Twilight,1.5,Go see Argylle in theaters February 2nd 2024
The Wind Rises,3,"God bless him, Hayao really loves his planes. I wish I did too.
Reminds me a lot of First Man, in the sense that it's an extremely well-made and well-directed biopic with a subject matter I couldn't care less about and couldn't get emotionally invested in no matter how hard I tried. The story picks up in the second half and the ending is good but this isn't something I intend on ever revisiting.
Did it deserve the Oscar over Frozen? Fucking obviously."
Do the Right Thing,4.5,"God, I'm overwhelmed by just about everything in this movie. The writing. The performances. The cinematography. EVERYTHING.
There are some slow patches here and there, but those are easy to overlook when you take into account how masterfully this film sets up its pieces over time only to knock them all down in one enthralling, breathtaking final act.
Fuck, man. THIS is a movie."
Beauty and the Beast,5,"God, what a work of art. Ever since I was a kid, I had a feeling that this movie was a cut above the rest of Disney's works, and boy was that feeling correct. The romance is perfect, the songs are gorgeous, the characters are endearing, and as a bonus, we get the meme dispenser that is Gaston. I love this movie with all my heart and I don't think I'll ever stop loving it."
Sleepy Hollow,3.5,"Goes insanely hard from a directorial standpoint, would have been really cool if the script matched that energy"
The Farewell,3,"Gonna have to sort this into the 'I don't get the hype' category of films sadly. It's a really great concept for a story, but it feels thoroughly underdeveloped. I wanted to learn more about who Billi is as a person, get more scenes exploring the cultural differences between America and China, and really see the main conflict and the ethics surrounding it get explored and fleshed out to a greater degree. But the movie just kinda felt repetitive after a while, never quite reaching the dramatic or comedic heights the story really deserved. Sorry, Nai Nai."
Munich,3.5,"Good movie but could not take the, uh, climax seriously"
Toy Story 4,3.5,"Good movie that never really justifies its existence. The supporting characters are great but they don't have a ton of funny jokes unfortunately. The stakes feel relatively low and a lot of the plotlines could have used more development. I liked it enough but it just barely rises above Finding Dory and Incredibles 2.
Oh, and it's better than the first movie at least. This is a solid 7 while that one is a shaky 7 teetering on 6"
Avengers: Endgame,3.5,Good-ass movie about a rat that saved the universe
The Little Mermaid,4.5,"Got a new big video ranking coming! This time, I'll take a look at all the Disney Renaissance films.
THIS ONE IS SO GOOD. Perfect pacing, stunning cinematography, breathtaking animation, vibrant colors, phenomenal songs, great characters. Ursula is such a bad bitch, Sebastian is hilarious, Ariel is really compelling. Seriously I don't remember this movie being this fantastic when did that happen???"
Toy Story 2,5,"Great comedy, strong dramatic touches, a really engaging central conflict, a ton of character depth...this is the bestest one"
Women Talking,4,Great movie but why is the color grading like that. Like I get what they're going for but you can make a movie look bleak without making it look like an antidepressants commercial
Kung Fu Panda 2,4,"Great sequel that isn't afraid to tell an even more emotionally rich story than its predecessor. It's much slower paced and not nearly as funny, but it shines in its second half and leads to a sensational climax. Ending really made me soft <3"
DAN DA DAN: First Encounter,4,Great show that I can't recommend to anyone because of the first episode üëç
One Battle After Another,5,"Grips you from the first minute and refuses to let go. Whether you're struck with fear by the ever-relevant depictions of militarized violence, or you're laughing at the hundredth dadfailure Leo moment, you're in for an absolutely unforgettable time at the movies. I seriously feel bad for every other film that comes out this year."
Dumbo,3,Grown ass elephant ladies beefing with a literal newborn lmao
The Croods,2.5,"GRUG MOMENT
Can't believe this is getting a sequel and not Rise of the Guardians smh"
Bedtime Stories,3,"Guy Pearce in this is the younger version of his character in The Brutalist, timelines be damned"
Alice-Heart,4,"Had a wonderful time with this film, felt a lot like Frances Ha but with its own Philly flair. Would love to see Lissa Carandang-Sweeney in more films. Also, don't think I didn't notice that Jim Thorpe Film Festival badge in Tony's car, I still have the same one from seeing Hundreds of Beavers there!"
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie,4.5,"Had to rewatch this in honor of March 14, THE DAY THAT KRABS FRIES"
The Tatami Galaxy,4,"Haha that's a funny little cowboy in the intro, I wonder what his character will be like-oh"
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,4,Haha WHAT is this movie? How were they even allowed to make it? How were you guys allowed to watch this as kids? Haha great stuff
Chicken Little,1,Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha fuck this movie hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Aladdin,2.5,"Half the time it's surprisingly good, well-acted and compelling. The other half it's hilariously incompetent to the point of providing tons of ironic enjoyment. So, I had a good time overall and I don't regret seeing it. It's a little sad that that's the bar I'm judging these live-action remakes on, but there we are."
The Lighthouse,5,Happy Halloween! Gonna go cook some lobster for me homies now
Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss,5,Happy New Year bubbies
Hard Eight,3.5,"Hard Eight? More like Hard Left, did not see some of these plot developments coming"
The Gingerweed Man,0.5,"Hark Triton, hark! Bellow, bid our father the Sea King rise from the depths full foul in his fury! Black waves teeming with salt foam to smother this young mouth with pungent slime, to choke ye, engorging your organs til‚Äô ye turn blue and bloated with bilge and brine and can scream no more -- only when he, crowned in cockle shells with slitherin‚Äô tentacle tail and steaming beard take up his fell be-finned arm, his coral-tine trident screeches banshee-like in the tempest and plunges right through yer gullet, bursting ye -- a bulging bladder no more, but a blasted bloody film now and nothing for the harpies and the souls of dead sailors to peck and claw and feed upon only to be lapped up and swallowed by the infinite waters of the Dread Emperor himself -- forgotten to any man, to any time, forgotten to any god or devil, forgotten even to the sea, for any stuff for part of Winslow, even any scantling of your soul is Winslow no more, but is now itself the sea!"
Leo,3,Have the songwriters ever seen a single musical before
Pig,4,Haven't felt this much tension during a dinner scene since Shrek 2 (2004)
I Married a Strange Person!,4.5,"Haven't laughed this hard at an animated film in so damn long. Bursting at the seams with unchecked creativity and lunacy. William and Hal will love this, Buster and Olivia will hate this, Yinsed, Puff, and Robyn could go either way but I'm leaning towards a positive reaction"
The Social Network,5,"Haven't seen this movie since I was 12 and yet I vividly remembered nearly every single scene and so many lines of dialogue. Such a masterfully crafted film in every way; screenplay, direction, editing, performances, the whole shebang. This film had 100% of my attention from beginning to end and I'm disappointed it didn't continue for another 10 hours. Not awarding this film Best Picture may be the Academy's most egregious mistake in a long and torturous line of egregious mistakes."
Minions: The Rise of Gru,2,He rose!
The Croods: A New Age,3.5,Heartbreaking: the worst movie you know just had a great sequel
Minority Report,4.5,Heavy Rain if it was good
Lady Bird,5,hella tight movie
Tarzan & Jane,1,"Hey Lois, remember the time Tarzan stopped a spy from toppling the British monarchy?"
Dune: Part Two,4.5,"Hey man, I get it, I don't really want to visit the South either"
Before Sunset,5,Hey wtf I believe in love now
The Lion King II: Simba‚Äôs Pride,3,Hey wtf they put effort into this
The Boy and the Heron,5,His best since Spirited Away. I do not say that lightly.
Paprika,3,"Hmm...I definitely vibed with the animation, sound design, direction, editing, all that good stuff. But to me, this lacked the emotional investment needed for one of these kinds of intentionally confusing and disorienting films to work. Perfect Blue managed to be more overwhelming to the senses AND more emotionally impactful by perfectly getting you into its protagonist's fractured headspace. This, by comparison, felt stretched in far too many directions for me to really connect with anything going on. I also don't really get the Inception comparisons - yes, people invade other people's dreams, but that's sort of where the plot similiarities end. Inception may lack an emotional core to some extent, but it has the benefit of an enthralling clear-cut heist plot with clear-cut stakes. This film, however, just felt vague, cold, stoic, and emotionally distant whenever it cut away from the imaginative dream sequences. A decent watch, but I'll probably be returning to Perfect Blue at least 5 more times before checking this one out again."
Eight Crazy Nights,1,"Holds the world record for the most times I've asked 'Wait, was that meant to be a joke' while watching a movie"
Ne Zha 2,4.5,Holy fucking shit
"It‚Äôs a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World",4,Holy shit dude lmfao
Boogie Nights,5,"Holy shit dude!
I could've watched the first party scene for another 3 hours and I don't even think that's one of the top 5 best scenes in the movie. They treat Mark Wahlberg's dick like it's the contents of the Pulp Fiction briefcase and it's great. I love when Don Cheadle is happy in movies!
Between this and Punch-Drunk Love, PTA might already be my new favorite director. And I haven't even seen There Will Be Blood yet! Fuck, man! Movies rule!"
Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Dead Reckoning,4.5,"Holy shit dude!!!!!!!! As awesome as the action and stunts in this series are, I think I'm a far bigger sucker for the espionage stuff that centers on the characters and what makes them tick. Grace's notable fear in the third act as a newbie to this game compelled me a lot more than the latest (still awesome, but expected) Tom Cruise stunt. Same goes for Benji and the bomb (he loves his friends <3)
THIS is the dramatic uptick in stakes I was missing from the last two. That news headline about Joe Biden being afraid of AI after watching this makes complete sense now. So damn excited to see how this ends. I like how Jeremy Renner's character just disappeared and no one ever mentions him again"
Soda Cracker,2,"Holy shit Soda, it's a helicopter"
The Batman,4,"Holy shit that score FUCKS. Michael Giacchino here are the keys to my house go fuck my wife
Yeah this movie is great! Robert Pattinson might be my favorite Batman to date, and his story actually has a ton of great shit to say about the very nature of the character. There's a line said towards the end that chilled me to the bone specifically because of who said it, and a scene shortly after which, while probably not intended to be a tear-jerker, actually got me a little weepy. It's just the exact sort of deconstruction and evolution this character needed, y'know?
Visually this feels the closest a movie has gotten to representing the look and feel of the Arkham games, which was a delight to see. It's a movie so confident in its story and world that it even throws in welcome dashes of the kind of comic-book silliness someone like Nolan would never dare to touch. And that's perfect! Batman stories deserve to be both serious and silly, and this is the first one I've seen that truly nails the tone of this character.
I prefer Dark Knight as a movie, but I think this is a better BATMAN movie, if that makes sense. A couple messy plot points and pacing issues hold it back a bit, but I could forsee a rewatch potentially bumping my score up to a 9. It'll be a real tough act to follow, but I truly can't wait to see what Matt Reeves has in store next."
Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout,4,"HOLY SHIT THAT'S A HELICOPTER CHASE SCENE
This one's probably got the best third act in the series, which I think goes a long way in terms of making up for how rehashy the story is. Villain uses Julia to get to Ethan like in 3, threat of nuclear fallout like in 4, the same villainous group and the return of the main villain from 5. Hell, even the helicopters are an (albeit far expanded) echo of 1's climax. Yes, the action still rules, but I found this story to be a bit less engaging than the last 3. Cavill is a great addition though, and this one's got some of the best deception scenes in the series (rad that Wolf Blitzer was down for that). And yes, the rumors are true, this one actually made me cry a bit at the end (a series first).
I don't quite see one of the best action films of all time here, but it's another link in this exhilarating chain of a franchise. 4 bangers in a row with more to come apparently, how do you manage that?"
May the 12th Be with You,0.5,"Holy shit THAT'S what Marge sounds like now????? Please free Julie Kavner oh my God
Deeply dire, artless, soulless, godless abomination. What are the jokes in this? When a ship lands and Ahsoka walks out of it, what's the joke there? That Ahsoka showed up??? And why does she have that fuckass Hutt baby from the Clone Wars movie?
The credits music is literally just a random piece of the Phantom Menace score from the scene where they leave Coruscant for Naboo. It doesn't even fit here! What are you DOING"
Peter Pan,4,Honestly could have been the best classic Disney movie if it wasn't for... (gestures to the racism)
Being John Malkovich,3.5,"Honestly fuck Maxine, Lotte deserves so much better"
Punch-Drunk Love,4.5,"Honestly most of his anger was justified, his sisters are annoying af"
Moulin Rouge!,4,Honestly the spinning shot of Christian and Satine during Elephant Love Medley might be my favorite shot in any movie ever sorry not sorry
Chicken for Linda!,4,"Honestly? I was rooting for Astrid the whole time, who tf just steals a chicken
Oooooooooh man I love stylized animation! Give me a unique sketchy vivid world with monochromatic characters over the pointless hyper-realism most American animated movies have been chasing any day of the week. Motion in a car looks so cool in this! Any scene with the lights turned off looks incredible! Boy oh boy do I love simple plots that lead to madcap shenanigans!
If the Academy doesn't nominate this for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song (it seems eligible since its worldwide release was this year) then that'll be sooooooo embarrassing for them. But yeah knowing them they're gonna overlook all 3 of the lovely little musical numbers in this and instead nominate the credits song from the Netflix Jerry Seinfeld Pop-Tart movie (remember that was a thing????????)"
Hop,0.5,"Hop is a 2011 American live-action/computer-animated comedy film produced by Illumination Entertainment, in association with Relativity Media, and distributed by Universal Pictures. The film was directed by Tim Hill and produced by Chris Meledandri and Michele Imperato Stabile, with a screenplay written by Brian Lynch, Cinco Paul, and Ken Daurio. Paul and Daurio also conceived the film's story. The film stars James Marsden, Russell Brand, Kaley Cuoco, Hank Azaria, Gary Cole, Elizabeth Perkins, David Hasselhoff, Chelsea Handler, and Hugh Laurie. The film follows a young rabbit E.B. (Brand) who would rather drum in a band than succeed his father as the Easter Bunny, as Fred O'Hare (Marsden) have the title for himself.
Hop was released in theaters on April 1, 2011, by Universal Pictures, and earned $184 million. To date, it is the only Illumination Entertainment film that combines live-action photography with animation."

Click,,"I came into this world in a hospital that no longer stands.
The unfortunate truth about our awesome and terrible existence as a species is that the institutions we create will not last forever. Doors will be shuttered, and as the generations march on, so too will our life's work be lost to the cold, unfeeling annals of History.
However, this sentiment need not apply to art.
Indeed, our creations meant to challenge and entertain audiences may endure long after we and everything we have ever stood for crumble into dust. Artistic expression is among the most beautiful and everlasting Concepts humanity has been graced with, and to that end, it would not be unwise to express the sentiment that some works of art, in the vast Cosmos of our existence since the dawn of time, have shone brighter than others.
I stand before you today to inform you of a truly momentous and incomparable milestone. I have at long last achieved 1,000 logs on the website Letterboxd. Long have the masses expressed their surprise that I have not born witness to more feature films at this point in time, but this is merely a reflection of my desire to experience art in all of its forms. Painting, literature, theater, sculpture, and games of the video variety; there is simply so much to experience across different mediums that I cannot relegate all of my limited time on this Earth to merely partaking in Cinema. My horizons are simply too broad for me to achieve the number of logs more befitting of my status as a frequently followed user on this website.
And yet, despite the relatively limited amount of time I am able to devote to cinema, I adore it and rank it among my favorite forms of artistic expression. I stand in utter awe of the meticulous craft and personal stamp that goes into even the dullest of feature films. Of course, this sensation is amplified one hundredfold for the greatest accomplishments the medium has to offer.
With that said... One such film has remained my most anticipated for quite some time. I did not consider myself yet worthy to witness its sheer Glory; however I believe my cinematic profile has advanced far enough to the point where basking in its presence is a worthwhile reward for the amount of time I devoted to the act of experiencing cinema.
Returning to that now defunct hospital, in the dreary afternoon hours of January 9th, 1998, having just been brought into the world and beholding my mother and father's faces for the first time, I immediately spoke aloud the words that would define my life goal for the following 26 years.
'When I reach 1,000 logs on the website Letterboxd, I would like the movie I watch for this momentous Milestone to be the Academy Award nominated film Click (2006) starring Adam Sandler.'
There has been a seemingly infinite amount of academic discussion surrounding Frank Coraci's experimental science fiction Faustian masterpiece, and as such, I feel as if I have nothing to contribute to such rigorous and intelligent discussions held by far greater minds than mine. However, simply leaving you with the preparations I endured for the most significant viewing experience of my life, without delving into the act of the screening itself, would be hearsay to the vision and efforts of Coraci and Sandler. I simply would never be able to live with myself had I ended the review there.
The Academy Award nominated feature film ‚ÄúClick‚Äù is a story about rediscovering the euphoric value of life. Sandler‚Äôs character Michael Newman, his name a brilliant dual reference to the Biblical Archangel Michael, and the classic Sitcomian character ‚ÄúNewman‚Äù from the masterful intertextual experience that is Jerry Seinfeld‚Äôs Seinfeld, finds himself suffering from the mundanity of existence and desires a change. The brilliance of this narrative arrives in the form of Christopher Walken‚Äôs character Morty, his name a brilliant reference to the eternal classic series Richard and Mortimer.
By offering Michael the inciting remote, which allows him to alter various aspects of his life in unexpected and often quite humorous ways, Morty is essentially putting the onus of godlike power into the hands of a mere mortal, much like how Satan tempted Eve with the Apple of Knowledge in the earliest known text in human history, the Quran.
However, in a divine act of cosmic mercilessness, the remote begins to go haywire, teaching Michael about the inherent value of his wonderful life in the process. The remote is the source of all the good, the bad, and the ugly in Michael‚Äôs world. On the one hand, he is the Godfather of his own destiny. But on the other hand, his life collapses around him in an instant, as if he triggered an apocalypse now. Michael initially is so overjoyed by the prospects offered by the remote that it would not be unexpected to find him singing in the rain. And yet, the inherent darkness tied to such a device enables most of Michael‚Äôs life to be gone with the wind. Citizen Kane.
The sheer brilliance of Academy Award nominated film ‚ÄúClick‚Äù is how deftly and decisively it balances the comedic and dramatic tones inherent to it. Comedy is, of course, a farce; laughter for the sake of laughter is a waste of time and has no place in artistic discussion. However, the use of crass comedy, such as [insert crass scene from the movie here after I watch it] is merely a facade, a veil meant to masquerade the sheer dramatic heft hidden in the later stages of the film. For Click is a litmus test meant to dispel the nonbelievers, the doubters of Frank Coraci‚Äôs singular and divinely inspired vision. If you have the gall to doubt the sheer brilliance of this magnum opus of the cinematic medium, then far be it from me to try and steer you back towards the right path. Bluntly put, it‚Äôs ok if you give this a bad review. You‚Äôre just stupid, is all.
The Academy Award nominated film Click was everything I long yearned for it to be and more. What a momentous achievement in the art of storytelling, performance, cinematography, editing, directing, costume design, production design, original score, original song, documentary feature, animated feature, etc. (The makeup was the only somewhat unexceptional portion of the film.) By the grace of the Lord my God, the brilliant and incomparable Frank Coraci, I stand before you a changed man, a humbled and divinely inspired one. I can never achieve something that captures the raw dramatic potency of ‚ÄúClick‚Äù, and yet, if I devote the remainder of my time on planet Earth to capturing a mere 0.001 percent of the film‚Äôs majesty and exceptional artistry, then perhaps I can definitively say that my contributions to society at large will be worth remembering‚Ä¶at least for a little while.
I am no fool. After I am long gone, my creative endeavors may persist for perhaps a generation or two, at the absolute maximum. My contributions to this planet will crumble into dust, the foundations buckling under the demented weight of time immemorial. And yours will too. Over the course of constructing my analysis, a startling revelation began to take form within my mind. History is selective in terms of the artistic pursuits it chooses to preserve. We must collectively come to terms with the irrelevance of both our lives and the creations we produce and distribute for the consumption of the populace. Not every piece of art will endure forever.
Yet, Academy Award nominated film Click (2006) starring Adam Sandler will.
2 out of 10"
Unfrosted,1.5,"I came to an unfortunate revelation about 15 minutes into this limp embarrassing farce: the concept of a cereal company feud being treated with the same weight and importance as the space race is a genuinely funny idea.
I suppose it's quite an amazing feat to waste such a strong concept on some of the most deeply unfunny writing I've seen in quite some time. I laughed precisely once throughout this whole ordeal, and that was merely at the sight of Hank Schrader dressed up as Khrushchev. I suppose having a funny idea isn't really the same as being funny yourself, and it's a shame there wasn't any genuine comedic talent behind this script. Off the top of my head, I wonder why they couldn't have gotten, say, Larry David?
Can't wait for the bullshit credits song to be nominated at the Oscars next year."
The Hunchback of Notre Dame,4,"I can never make up my mind about this one. It's a gigantic tonal mess with awful slapstick and comic relief, but this one ultimately has some of the best dramatic moments and songs in the entire Disney pantheon. The stage adaptation is better but kudos to Disney for really giving it their all with this one and creating a cult classic that's starting to gain more recognition as time goes on"
The Pirates of Penzance,4,I cannot believe that was the plot of this musical the whole time
Atlantis: The Lost Empire,4.5,"I can't believe how amazing this movie is.
Then again, these are the directors behind Beauty and the Beast, Hunchback of Notre Dame, and The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper, so I can't believe I didn't expect this to be amazing."
Shazam!,4.5,I can't believe they got Sans Undertale to play the villain in this movie
Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace,2,I can't believe they ripped off the podracing track in this from The Mandalorian
Ralph Breaks the Internet,1.5,I can't decide if I hate the movie itself more or I hate what it represents more but suffice to say I hate both of them pretty significantly
Ford v Ferrari,4,"I can't decide what's more shocking; the fact that this movie was actually pretty great, or the fact that this is the second Best Picture nominee this year where Tracy Letts plays a stuffy old rich dude who I don't like at first but actually starts to grow on me over time"
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,5,I can't think of another movie that genuinely gets better and better on repeat viewings to this extent. Wow.
Pinocchio,1.5,I checked how much time was left in the movie at least once per minute
Anger Management,2,I coulda been rewatching West Side Story instead of this
The Match-Stick Flame 2: Lunada Bay,2.5,I cried at the end. I think. Honestly it's all just kind of a blur
Shrek the Third,1,I didn't actually rewatch it. I just wanted to hop on and remind everyone that this movie doesn't exist. Viva la Shrek 4
The Muppet Christmas Carol,2.5,"I didn't actually watch it yet, I just wanted to read the comments if I did this"
The Tale of The Princess Kaguya,5,I didn't even know movies could be this good.
Her,4,"I didn't like this movie when I was 15 and I think I was just an idiot back then because this is really great. Very smart screenplay that showcases Theodore's loneliness and Samantha's insecurities in increasingly profound and sad ways.
I just...don't really care for the last arc of the movie? It doesn't feel very well set up and it didn't really hook me emotionally like the rest of the film. Still, it's really touching and I'm gonna go punch 15-year-old me in the face for saying otherwise"
A Complete Unknown,3,I didn't really know anything about Bob Dylan beforehand and after watching it I still feel like I don't. Timmy good
Big Eyes,3,I didn't think Christoph Waltz gave a particularly good performance in this but I guess I should count myself lucky Tim didn't cast Johnny Depp instead
Ouija Shark 2,2,I don't even know where to start
The Return of the Living Dead,4,I don't know if this actually happened in real life
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,3,I don't trust mfs who say this is their favorite Indiana Jones movie
Ernest Goes to Africa,1,I expected the 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' of the Ernest franchise and instead I got the 'Cars 2' mixed with racism
1941,1,"I feel like it's usually really reductive to say 'that's two hours of my life I'm never gonna get back' about a movie
But like"
Wizards,3.5,I feel like my life can now be separated into two distinct eras: 'pre-Wizards' and 'post-Wizards'
Cowboy Bebop: The Movie,3.5,"I feel like there's at least a dozen other episodes that would've better suited the length of a feature film than this story, but it's hard to complain about getting extra time with these amazing characters.
Still haven't seen the final 4 episodes yet, so no spoilers in the comments! (Oh, wait, never mind >:)"
The Power of the Dog,3,"I feel like this movie really hinged on its performances to tell the story rather than relying on the script, which is why it bums me out that I was just not sold on the performances given by Kodi Smit-McPhee and especially Banana Mania Cucumbersnatch. The latter just didn't convince me he was a rough-and-tumble cowboy at any point and it severely dampened what could otherwise have been an incredibly compelling character study.
The pacing is rather glacial, which wasn't a deal-breaker thanks in no small part to the great score, stunning cinematography, and solid performances from Plemons and Dunst working with what little the movie gives them. I really wish I could like this movie as much as everyone else seems to; the intentions of the story are smart and well-realized on paper, I just wish the lead actors could have drawn me in outside of a few fleeting scenes."
Airplane!,3.5,I feel like we don't talk about the lady who fucked a horse enough
Hellblazers,1,I forgot literally every single thing about this movie 10 seconds after it finished
A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,4.5,I fucking love watching Snoopy get bodied by that folding chair every Thanksgiving
Creature from the Black Lagoon,2,I guess I just don't like G-rated horror movies devoid of interesting characters that abruptly end out of nowhere after blasting siren noises in my ears for 80 minutes and calling that a 'score'
Portrait of a Lady on Fire,4.5,I guess we're adding the number 28 to the list of things I never expected to emotionally destroy me and send me into a fit of sobbing
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,3.5,"I had only ever seen Vincent D'onofrio as Kingpin before this, does he just talk like that for every role all the time"
Knives Out,5,"I had some chest pains the first time I saw this, and I blame those for distracting me from the fact that this is a goddamn 10/10"
Babe,3,I had to catch up on the Babe lore before watching Pig in the City for a video. Cute I guess. Should've been animated
Happy Feet,1,I hate this movie's guts
Open Season: Scared Silly,1.5,"I have officially watched 13 of the 26 Sony Animated movies. Exactly half of the ranking is in place.
This movie is currently one of the top 5 best ones.
Yeah."
Jurassic Park,5,"I have seen the light.
Been watching a lot of Spielberg lately, and out of what I've seen so far, this is the movie he directs the FUCK out of the most.
Jeff Goldblum in this has more rizz than any man who ever lived"
Spencer,3,I hope Kristen Stewart and Jonny Greenwood's backs are okay from carrying this movie
Lady and the Tramp,2,I hope she made lotsa spaghetti
Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom,4,I hope they cleaned that piano in the rehearsal room
The Rat Catcher,4,"I know the gimmick is that these are meant to be plays, but c'mon, we were robbed of a stop motion ferret"
Going Overboard,1,I laughed 0 times
She‚Äôs the Man,3,"I like how Olivia doesn't even consider the fact that she could be bi, just 'Oh yep I'm gonna date this guy I don't know at all because I fell in love with his sister who was impersonating him' like ??????????????????"
Opera,3.5,I like how that little girl just lived in that vent
Edward Scissorhands,4.5,I like how the climax was the same as Beauty and the Beast a year before Beauty and the Beast came out
Amistad,3,I like the part where the movie reaches a natural climax and then it keeps going for 45 more minutes
Return of the Jedi,4.5,"I like this one better than A New Hope! Phenomenal sets and creatures, the best action of the trilogy, incredibly strong emotion. The fact that Luke doesn't give up on redeeming Vader, even when Obi-Wan and Yoda tell him Anakin is long gone, is immensely powerful.
The Ewoks are hilarious and I don't have much to complain about with them. Jabba slays me with all of his wacky line deliveries. Overall, the humor in this film works surprisingly well, to the point where it might be the funniest Star Wars film.
For a pretty flatly-written character at the time, Ian McDiarmid absolutely kills it as Palpatine. He manages to embody the ultimate evil in the galaxy while also bringing a fair share of humor to the table. There is something so hilariously petty about him smugly telling Luke 'I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø' He's one of the great cinematic villains, and while the prequels did most of the heavy lifting to get him there, this movie is still a pretty vital piece of the puzzle.
Exciting, emotional, epic, and above all, fun, Return of the Jedi is undoubtably one of the best Star Wars films ever made."
Madagascar 3: Europe‚Äôs Most Wanted,2,I like to move it move it out of the theater after the first 20 minutes are over cause wow the movie goes downhill hard
RoboCop,4,I like when the robot fell down the stairs
Titanic,4.5,"I liked how during every nighttime scene you could actually see everything that was happening onscreen, more movies should do that"
Kimi,3,"I liked it when she was in the apartment, after that ehhhhhhhhh. Congrats to this movie for being the first one to use dutch angles correctly though!"
At Land,4,I liked the guy with the mustache
Inside Out 2,,I liked the part where Disgust used the Perceive ability from Apollo Justice
The Wedding Singer,3,I liked the part where everybody clapped
Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween,2.5,I liked the parts where Jack Black
Spanglish,3,I liked the scenes where Adam Sandler was a chef because they reminded me of Jon Favreau's Chef (2014). If you know you know
Fantastic Four,2.5,I liked when Johnny got launched into the Whopper sign and turned it into a Flame Grilled Whopper‚Ñ¢
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind,3.5,I liked when the big meatball man shot all the spaghetti tongued bugs
Not Just a Goof,4,I love da movies
My Neighbor Totoro,4.5,"I love how Totoro calls the cat bus for Satsuki and then he's like 'Alright, I ain't getting on that shit, my work here is done, peace'"
The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special,4,I love these crazy idiots so much
Kakushigoto,4,"I love wacky slice-of-life anime, Charlie! I LOVE WACKY SLICE-OF-LIFE ANIMEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,4.5,I made an unspeakable cut of this movie that the world is not ready for
Free Birds,5,I mean it
The Prince of Egypt,5,I mean this is basically the best animated film ever made
Becoming Jane,3,I mean...it's no Pride and Prejudice (2005) but then again what is
Top Gun,2.5,I might be the only person who's ever noticed this but this movie has gay undertones?????????
Despicable Me 3,2,I miss my homie Vector
Madagascar 3: Europe‚Äôs Most Wanted,3,I must be out of my GODDAMN MIND cause I kinda liked it this time
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,5,I must've said 'oh my God' at least 80 times while watching this. Holy shit now THIS is a fucking movie
Porky in Wackyland,3,I need to watch every Looney Tune and get caught up on the lore before I see that new one in theaters
Belle‚Äôs Magical World,1,I never want to see any of these characters again
A.I. Artificial Intelligence,4.5,I promise you will never in a million years guess where the plot of this movie goes
I Lost My Body,3.5,I really gotta hand it to this movie
Fargo,4,"I really, REALLY, wanted to punch William H. Macy's character in the face the whole movie"
Dreamgirls,3.5,I somehow didn't realize that was Beyonce until the end credits
Anora,4.5,I still have not recovered from the final shot of this film and I don't know if I ever will
Hundreds of Beavers,4.5,"I still remember getting invited to the Jim Thorpe Film Festival in 2023 and experiencing this comedic marvel with a huge crowd who laughed like crazy and loved every second. I distinctly remember thinking, 'God, the general public is gonna adore this as long as they actually get to see it.'
Nearly 2 years and 112,000 Letterboxd logs later, I couldn't be prouder of what Mike and Ryland have achieved. :)"
The Lion King 1¬Ω,3.5,I swear I've already watched this entire movie 3 times since Disney Plus launched
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,1,I take back every mean thing I ever said about Attack of the Clones.
Cars 2,1,I take back every mean thing I ever said about Shrek the Third. And The Good Dinosaur. And Turbo. And MINIONS. Fuck you John Lasseter
Bratz: Rock Angelz,5,"I take my Letterboxd very seriously
Wendie Malick deserved an Oscar for this"
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,4,I think I speak for everyone when I say we needed more Wade Whipple üò°
Mike‚Äôs New Car,4.5,I think it's safe to say this is better than the entirety of Monsters University
The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),4.5,"I think Noah Baumbach has become my favorite screenwriter; his movies capture the complexity and messiness of relationships so effortlessly, be they friendships, marriages, or in this case, parental bonds (or lack thereof). There's a whole lot of truth in this script and these performances, and the film choked me up on more than one occasion.
The first half of the film is basically flawless but the second half loses the snappy, nonstop compelling dialogue in favor of slower, less interesting shenanigans and a really awkwardly edited fight scene. Couldn't really decide when to end either, but overall, another excellent entry in Baumbach's amazing repertoire."
Ted,3,I think Seth MacFarlane just made this so he could meet Flash Gordon
The Lorax,1,I think the past 10 years of funny haha memes and epic Danny Devito moments distracted me from the fact that this is heinously awful lmao
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,3,"I think what ultimately prevents the magnificent Andor from elevating the installment it leads into, whereas something like Clone Wars did wonders for heightening the tragedy of Revenge of the Sith, is the fact that this film simply does not hinge on Cassian as a character the way Sith hinges on Anakin. Sure, I got more emotional at Cassian's fate in this film knowing the full context of his life, but before you get to that (and the admittedly still great final battle), you have to deal with bizarre pacing, an overstuffed roster of characters, some truly groan-worthy cameos, and the unmistakable stench of reshoots that don't paint this as the most cohesive film in the world. To top that all off, this simply isn't Cassian's story anymore. He still plays a crucial role, but this makes for a jarring and disjointed pseudo-finale to Andor, which I wouldn't mind so much if the actual Andor finale wasn't so insistent that you watch this movie to get the full picture. I know why they did that, it makes sense. But it doesn't stop me from wishing this film was a whole lot better. Krennic wasn't fruity enough here like he was in the show"
War Horse,1.5,I thought he was gonna kiss the horse multiple times
The Muppets,4.5,I threw up a little when I saw the Cars 2 billboard
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,4.5,"I ugly sobbed. I love this movie so fucking much. It's a top 3 MCU movie for me and I could watch it a million times without getting tired of it. I will be making a video about why this is a perfect sequel, don't you worry."
Memento,5,"I use habit and routine to make my life possible. Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work. Me? Yeah, I got a reason.
Oh so this was as good as everyone else has been saying for decades huh"
The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,2.5,I visibly pogged when I saw the Patty Wagon
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,3,I want a spinoff about dead actor detective Willem Dafoe
Beetlejuice,3,I want a spinoff about the football players
Luca,4,I want shorter Pixar movies with less ambitious stories filled with likable characters who vibe more and do less and I'm not kidding
"Night Is Short, Walk On Girl",4,I want to live in Masaaki Yuasa's wacky incomprehensible gorgeous life-affirming world
Song of the Sea,4,"I wanted to watch Wolfwalkers but Apple TV Plus declined my credit card :(
This is good too :)"
The Trial of the Chicago 7,4,"I was expecting to be bored out of my mind but this was honestly really engaging from start to near-finish. Top notch editing and the direction isn't nearly as bad as everyone on here is saying. Rylance steals the show amidst the excellent stacked cast. I think a couple of Sorkin's lines are too Sorkin-y for their own good, and it ends on an extremely bizarre and out-of-nowhere note, but overall, a highly enjoyable film."
Paddington 2,5,"I was gonna give it a 9/10 but that last shot before the credits...fuck it 10/10. It may not be the single greatest movie ever made, but I can think of nothing else that deserves the title of 'best-reviewed film of all time' more than this."
Sherlock Jr.,4,"I was like 'Yeah this is fine I suppose' at first, and then the climax ended up being one of the most insane things I've ever witnessed. This guy's very good at pool!"
Coco,4,I was so close to getting through this Pixar marathon without crying once. SO CLOSE. Fuck this movie. It's too amazing.
Magnolia,4.5,I was told 'You'll never in a million years guess how this movie ends' but actually it was very easy to predict
Piranha II: The Spawning,1.5,I watched it for the exact reason you're thinking
Miranda Sings Live‚Ä¶ Your Welcome,0.5,"i watched this against my will
How was anyone surprised about her being a groomer???"
Digital Video Editing with Adobe Premiere Pro: The Real-World Guide to Set Up and Workflow,4,I watched this for the title and it did not disappoint
Mr. Deeds,,I watched this when I was 14 and did not like it
Wish,2,I will forget everything about this movie by tomorrow
Onward,2,"I wish I could say that this is funnier and has a more coherent story than the average D&D session, but...
...at least the ending was good?"
Encanto,4.5,I wish I could send this film back in time so 10-year-old me could see it. He really needed it.
Hercules,4.5,"I...like this more than Hunchback. I can't believe it either. It's just such a witty, energetic screwball comedy with an amazingly expressive animation style and a story structure that takes full advantage of the fact that it's a musical. Every song is a banger as well. I guess it's tonally inconsistent at times, but really, who cares when the characters are incredible and the story, while basic, is really heartfelt and compelling? I could go on but I'll save it for the video. Bottom line is, this movie slaps."
Saludos Amigos,3,"I'd honestly love to see a modern interpretation of this half-documentary, half-animated short collection style of film, made by people who actually come from the culture that's being adapted. It'd be pretty cool without the blatant commodification of South American culture by U.S. businessmen.
Fun animated segments and a nice breezy watch at only 42 minutes."
Persepolis,4,"Idc if you hate reading, you GOTTA check out the original graphic novel if you love this film"
The Jungle Book,2.5,Idk man the songs were great but this was kinda boring overall
Don‚Äôt Look Up,1.5,If anything this movie may have accelerated climate change
Everything Everywhere All at Once,4.5,If Banshees of Inisherin was in the hot dog finger universe then Padriac and Colm could've just eaten mustard out of each other's fingers and been ok
Spirited Away,5,If I could give this movie 6 stars I would
The Soccer Football Movie,1,"If I had a nickel for every time this movie references The Thing, I'd have two nickels. Which is coincidentally what this movie cost to make"
Ponyo,4,If I made my Ghibli ranking today this would be like 7 spots higher or something
Black Narcissus,4,If I was an audience member in 1947 some of the edits and musical cues in this would make me shit myself
All That Jazz,5,If the ending song so horrific and disturbing then why so catchy
Bolt,2.5,If the main character was voiced by Adam West it would've been good
Lake Michigan Monster,4.5,"If the movies Hollywood put out had even an ounce of this film's creativity, the film industry would be in a pretty good state. Drop whatever you're doing right now and watch this."
The Waterboy,3,"If the sight of Kathy Bates doing a little dance on the sidelines doesn't make you crack a smile, you might be dead inside"
Anna and the Apocalypse,3,If there was a version of this movie that's gone through like 5 more script revisions it would be one of my all-time favorites
Much Ado About Nothing,3.5,"If there's one thing Shakespeare was missing, it's brooding Keanu Reeves"
The Witches of Eastwick,4.5,If this came out today most of the top reviews would just be 'do they need a fifth'
Vampire‚Äôs Kiss,2.5,If this movie starred anyone but Nicolas Cage it would be unwatchable
The Angry Birds Movie 2,3.5,If this was anything other than an Angry Birds sequel it would have a 3.9 average
Uncut Gems,5,If this was set in 2025 the bejeweled Furbys would've been Labubus. Glad we don't live in that timeline
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,2,"If you have any attachment to Ahsoka's character whatsoever, don't rewatch this movie."
Fate/stay night: Heaven‚Äôs Feel II. Lost Butterfly,3.5,"If you think about it, this movie's conflict is very similar to the one in Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"
Knuckles,2.5,If you thought Episode 4 was the worst one then you are weak and will not survive the winter
The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper,4,If you thought I wasn't gonna end Christmas off by watching the best DreamWorks film then you're solely mistaken
The Dark Knight,5,"If you told me out of all the Batman movies this is the one where he goes to a rave, I would not believe you"
Moby & the Void Pacific Choir: Are You Lost in the World Like Me,1,I'm beginning to think that smartphones are actually making us less connected.
Once,3,"I'm definitely missing something here cause this didn't work very well for me at all. It leaves a terrible first impression with the cinematography at the beginning, but that aspect improves as the film goes along (even if the flat lighting doesn't). The bigger issue for me is how the script feels entirely barebones, rendering the story and romance very basic and unengaging. I don't feel a particularly strong connection between the main characters and I don't feel like I know them well at all.
The movie's saving grace is definitely the music; every song sequence is genuinely magical and it elevates the entire package. I wish I could just fall in love with this film; it's impressive for a low-budget picture and I'll probably be listening to the songs again. I'll probably give the Broadway musical a try; hopefully without the budget-related issues this film is unfortunately afflicted with, and hopefully with a better script, I'll get into it a lot more."
The Hunchback of Notre Dame II,0.5,I'm going to throw up
Home,2.5,"I'm impressed, this wasn't terrible!
It also wasn't good!"
Shrek,3.5,"I'm in the process of going through every Best Animated Feature winner for an upcoming video. Might as well review them yo
So Shrek is really good. The cast is pitch-perfect and their line deliveries add so much to their characters. Very mature love story with great humor, though a little dull at some points. Pales in comparison to Shrek 2 but still a great movie in its own right"
High School Musical 3: Senior Year,3,"I'm losing my fucking mind because during The Boys Are Back, Chad sings 'Just like a showdown, Will Smith and Bobby De Niro'. As far as I know, the only film Will Smith Robert and De Niro have both appeared in is Shark Tale, where their characters (Oscar and Don Lino, respectively) have a showdown.
High School Musical made an explicit reference to Shark Tale.
Amazing."
Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny,0.5,I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the bottom 5 worst movies I've ever watched
The Nightmare Before Christmas,3.5,"I'm not sure why they hired a different voice actor for Jack's speaking voice when he has like 5 spoken lines
Anyway yeah good movie, visually stunning if a bit slight on story. Songs are aight"
Bo Burnham: Inside,5,I'm pretty new to Bo Burnham's work but the fact that he managed to treat me to a captivating rock opera odyssey without ever leaving his room is just...beyond incredible. I'm speechless
Grave of the Fireflies,4.5,I'm struggling to think of any other movie that eviscerated my heart quite like this one.
The Muppet Christmas Carol,4,I'm tired of these stupid debates over whether this is a Halloween or Christmas movie! It is a HALLOWEEN movie! There are GHOSTS! A little boy DIES! The Christmas future muppet is SCARY! If you think it's a Christmas movie you're LYING! Happy Halloween!!!!!!!!!!
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,4,Imagine being lactose intolerant and it just fucking rains ice cream. That's like acid rain. Fuck you Flint Lockwood for not taking food allergies seriously
The French Dispatch,4.5,Imagine directing this. Wes Anderson you absolute KING
Attack of the Crab Monsters,1,Imagine making a movie about giant enemy crabs boring
Logan,4.5,Imagine thinking this isn't the best superhero movie of the 2010s lmfao
Emilia P√©rez,1.5,"Impressive! A musical with zero (0) good songs!
If Selena Gomez gets nominated for an Oscar for this performance I am keying the Academy's cars"
The Rocky Horror Picture Show,5,"In middle school I assumed everybody loved this movie because it was so bad it's good.
Now I realize that everybody loves it because it's just kind of a perfect movie. Like, name a single thing you would change about it. You can't.
Someone showed up to our midnight screening dressed as the Lorax"
Cars,2.5,In my junior year of high school we had to watch this movie in health class and write a paper on Lightning McQueen's character growth and how he forms healthy relationships with the people around him over the course of the movie. So that was fun
The War with Grandpa,1.5,"In the course of his brilliant career, Robert De Niro has teamed with Tim Hill to bring us a wide range of uniquely complicated villains. His latest performance in 'The War With Grandpa' delivers a different type of evil, not of a mobster or a psychotic loner, but of a grandpa consumed by greed and his lust for power. Mr. De Niro, in an Oscar-winning...uh, Oscar-worthy performance, gives us a reminder of the heart of darkness within our ancestral blood. Congratulations to an acting legend."
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,2.5,"In Victor's defense, it is really tough deciding between preventing the apocalypse and getting a cool surfboard"
Flee,3.5,Insanely powerful and raw but I feel like the style kinda held me back from fully connecting with it unfortunately
Minari,4.5,"Intimate and gorgeous. I was a bit iffy on the score, but otherwise, one of the best slice-of-life films I've seen in ages. I hope it gets all the Oscars, but even if it doesn't, it got my heart. And that's all that matters."
ted,4,Is he doing fucking Pippin?
Godzilla Minus One,4,Is it normal to come out of one of these movies having enjoyed the human characters more than Godzilla?
The Thing,5,"Is that a man in there or something?
Just gonna go ahead and pretend I saw this in theaters yesterday instead of sitting on my office chair watching it on my laptop"
Open Season,2,It could have been worse
Drive My Car,4.5,"'It didn't sound like he was lying. I don't know if it's the truth, but he was telling you what was true to him.'
Fucking hell this destroyed me emotionally. A rather unwieldy slow burn that didn't fully grab me at first, but as the story progressed it revealed the necessity of every seemingly irrelevant detail in the first half. I went from thinking 'Yeah it's a good movie that needed to shave down that 40 minute prologue' to 'Holy shit, this is a masterclass in subtle dramatic payoffs' by the end. Please stick with this movie if it doesn't click with you at first; it's a long slow drive, but it's absolutely worth it to get to the destination."
Big Fish,4,"It doesn't matter, just keep telling the story."
Yona of the Dawn,3.5,It ended just as it was getting really good :/
Hustle,4,"It features the only Adam Sandler character who canonically went to Temple, of course I liked this"
April and the Extraordinary World,4,It feels like there should be talking monkeys in this movie and yet there are no talking monkeys
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,3,It is extremely funny that this is an Academy Award nominated film
Alvin and the Chipmunks,2,"It is finished. Father, into your hands, I commend my spirit."
Booksmart,4.5,It just got funnier the second time lmao
The Sword in the Stone,2,It should be illegal for a movie about a wizard to be this boring
Shrek 2,5,"It took me 16 years to finally give this movie the 5 star rating it unironically deserves. Every scene is great. Every joke lands. It's emotionally moving. It's incredibly exciting. It's a fucking miracle of a movie, I cannot stress that enough"
Low Blow,1.5,It was a movie I suppose
Space Jam: A New Legacy,1.5,It was awful and I loved it
Hamilton,5,It was neat
Free Birds,5,"It wasn't the Great Turkey, it was always Reggie.
A cacophony of fire and fury. A magnificent mind-bending fable depicting a harrowing and ever-relevant tale of nature triumphing over man. Hard to imagine the human race as a species ever topping this artistic achievement."
Teen Titans Go! To the Movies,3,"It would be so awesome
It would be so cool"
Nobody,3,It's always rough when movies end just as they start getting good. Cool to see Christopher Lloyd again tho
The Dirt Bike Kid,2.5,It's crazy how the magic dirt bike has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie
Ant-Man,2.5,"It's cute for an hour but then I got really bored and I wanted to turn it off. Rewatches have usually slightly improved the Marvel origin movies for me, but it did the opposite here"
The Brutalist,3,"It's difficult to articulate why this didn't fully work for me. The performances and direction were solid but the story felt like a rather stock deconstruction of the American Dream, one that rarely surprised or engaged me. I'll take this over an Emilia Perez win in any category however."
Jay Kelly,3.5,"It's good, but there's an inescapable 'woe is me' quality that never fully goes away even during Clooney's best scenes. It quickly becomes evident that the emotional core lies with Sandler's character, to the point where I had to question why the story wasn't about him. As a Baumbach fan I'm disappointed that the dialogue wasn't sharper and the message wasn't conveyed in a more subtle manner; it really isn't like him to turn in a script so standard. Credit where it's due, though, that one scene with Billy Crudup is among the year's best. Currently undecided if this is going above or below Big Daddy on the Sandler ranking"
The Emperor‚Äôs New Groove,4,It's honestly kind of miraculous this movie works as well as it does. I feel like the lack of songs is really felt in this one (especially since Snuff Out the Light is a great villain song that was unfairly cut) but the fantastic comedy bits and amazing character development for Kuzco make this such a blast to rewatch over and over
Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones,1.5,"It's incredible how the line 'Jedi Poodoo' is basically the theme of the entire prequel trilogy. Bravo George
I only raised the score because of ironic enjoyment"
Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss,5,It's my birthday and Jess said I could pick the movie
Barbie as The Princess & the Pauper,3,It's no Bratz: Rock Angelz but it's still cinema
Robin Hood,3.5,It's no 'YTP: Friar's Rubbing Wood - Fall Of Nottingham' but it ain't half bad
Kubo and the Two Strings,3,"It's not great, it's not terrible. Some absolutely stunning animation anchors an aggressively predictable and mediocre story with a really annoying side character. It's fine but I really don't anticipate checking it out again"
Toy Story,3.5,"It's not really amazing until the last 20 minutes, but man are those last 20 minutes amazing. Woody is an annoying asshole most of the movie, Sid's house is such an unpleasant location, and the animation has aged way worse than I remember. But ultimately the Woody-Buzz dynamic carries this movie pretty far. Still, 2 and 3 outshine it pretty hard."
Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss,5,It's our 3 year anniversary and Jess wanted to watch this
Into the Unknown: Making Frozen II,4,"It's probably a bad sign when the behind-the-scenes documentary is more consistently entertaining than the movie, right?"
Spirited Away,5,It's Spirited Away what the hell else do you need to know
The Flying Sailor,2,It's the size of this walnut except way smaller
Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes,4.5,"It's up to you whether you go or not. You'll go, though!
This is a message from 70 minutes in the future. Click on the link below right now, and watch this overlooked gem on Tubi for FREE. It's FREE! And only 70 minutes! It's so good!!!! You won't regret this!
tubitv.com/movies/671945/beyond-the-infinite-two-minutes"
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,5,"I've always been a little hung up on some of the excessive silliness and some of the similarities to Raiders' formula, but on this rewatch, it finally hit me that this is my favorite adventure movie of all time. Why the hell shouldn't it get 5 stars"
Little Shop of Horrors,4,"I've always championed this as the one movie adaptation of a musical that actually improved upon the original stage version, but after rewatching it for the first time in forever, I'm not so sure that's true. I think I was just taken in by the best puppet effects ever put to film and the insanely incredible 'Mean Green Mother from Outer Space' song to notice how many songs that contribute crucial story and character beats were cut. It's not like the original musical is particularly long; I see no reason to cut as much as they did outside of maybe budgetary restrictions.
Cut songs is par for the course for any movie adaptation of a musical; what really stings, though, is the theatrical ending. Without spoiling anything, it just...doesn't gel with the messages the story is trying to portray. Seek out the original ending if you're planning to watch this; it's amazing to see the musical's ending fully realized on the big screen, and it works a hell of a lot better than the sappy conclusion we actually got.
I've been complaining a lot in this review but the score is still high because Little Shop is simply THAT good of a musical, and this is still one of the best stage-to-film adaptations out there. I'd probably give it a 9/10 if I had never seen the original musical and didn't know which parts were missing. And if you've never seen the original musical, this movie is an amazing way to get into it. Please don't remake it, Hollywood. Leave it alone."
Parasite,4.5,"I've come to make an announcement:
The Academy is a bitch ass motherfucker. They pissed on Song Kang-Ho's chances of getting a Supporting Actor nod. That's right, this bunch of quilly dicks pissed all over a truly nuanced and powerful performance and they said Brad Pitt's dick was 'this big' and I said 'that's disgusting'.
So I'm making a callout post on my letterboxd dot com: Academy, you got a small dick, its the size of this peach except way smaller. And guess what? Here's what my dong looks like. That's right baby, all point, no cake, no meat skewers, look at that it looks like two balls and a Bong Joon-Ho.
They fucked my dude's Oscar chances so guess what? I'm gonna fuck the Kim's basement house. That's right this is what you get, MY SUPER RAINSTORM PISS. Except I'm not pissing on the Kim's home, I'm gonna go higher, I'M PISSING ON THE PARK'S MANSION. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT TODD PHILLIPS, I PISSED ON THE MANSION YOU IDIOT!
You have twenty-three hours before the piss drop-el-ets hit the fucking Oscars, now get out of my fucking sight, before I piss on you too"
Only Yesterday,4.5,I've only seen two of his movies so far and I'm already prepared to declare Isao Takahata one of the greatest writer/directors in animation history
Free Birds,5,I've seen this movie more times than I've seen my children
Lincoln,2,"I've seen this movie three times. I have TRIED to like it.
But goddammit this is one of the most boring films I've ever seen in my life. Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones are the only things holding this movie together."
"Men, Women & Children",1.5,Jason Reitman really thought he had something with this one
Sentimental Value,4.5,Jay Kelly for grown ups
Super Shark,1.5,Jerma shark movie Jerma shark movie
Sing Street,4.5,"John Carney's progression as a writer/director is really exciting to watch; this is a tremendous step up in every way from the earnest but mediocre Once. It's an absolute overload of charm from beginning to end and it's ridiculously hard to dislike. I mean this boy just made up an entire band out of nowhere just to impress this one girl, that's some r/madlads shit"
Halloween,3.5,John Carpenter putting the original Thing on a TV in this movie only to make his own Thing a few years later is peak foreshadowing
A Quiet Place,3,"John Krasinski is clearly a very talented horror director, but unfortunately his deft touch is burdened with a really stupid script that puts its characters in unnecessary danger for the sake of getting more scares. Worth a watch, but I don't expect to check it out again."
Treasure Planet,3,"John Silver is honestly way too interesting and well-written of a character for this movie
Doppler and Amelia seemed potentially interesting, cool of the movie to forget they exist and shove them into a forced rushed side romance
The only way I can imagine a character as annoying as B.E.N. working is if he was voiced by the guy who voices Master Shake/Gazpacho
Mr. Arrow was not the impostor
I have nothing but respect for Ron and John but I can't believe THIS was the passion project they desperately wanted to make for nearly 20 years"
Konga TNT,0.5,"Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be King (Kong)"
The Dark Knight Rises,2.5,Just as good as I remember it!
El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,3.5,"Just finished the series for the first time and immediately watched this afterwards.
I know that whole 'name a character that suffered more, I'll wait' thing is a big funny haha meme, but honestly. Name a character that suffered more than Jesse fucking Pinkman. I...really needed this.
Todd is so weird lmao"
The Secret World of Arrietty,3.5,Just found out after the fact that there's a British dub featuring Saoirse Ronan AND non-Westernized character names and I'm so pissed I didn't watch that version instead
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,5,Just noticed I logged this 3 years in a row so I might as well go for 4! Watching this on cable at 1am the way God intended
The Mitchells vs. the Machines,4,Katie would make some bitchin YouTube Poops
Kaiju Glam Metal Shark Attack,0.5,Kellyheads we are so back
Barbie,5,Ken outta Ken
The Banshees of Inisherin,4.5,Kid named Finger
The Smurfs,1,Kill yoursmurf
The Smurfs 2,1,Kill yoursmurf 2
Empire of the Sun,3,"Kind of feels like the exact middle ground between overly whimsical and sentimental Spielberg, and 'director of Schindler's List' Spielberg. He's getting to the point where he can effectively direct a powerful drama, just give him time."
Once Upon a Studio,4.5,"Kind of impossible not to be charmed by; a true labor of love that feels less like 'look at all these things we own' and more like 'look at all these things we made'. Big fucking difference!
Yeah I teared up a little at the Quasimodo bit what of it"
Mission: Impossible,3.5,Kind of just decent but I bumped up the score because that one scene had a helicopter in it and that ruled
I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry,2.5,Kind of sweet at times. Maybe the most pro-gay homophobic movie ever made
Coco,4,"Kinda flawed in the story department in a lot of ways but I honestly don't care. This is a beautiful love letter to Mexican culture and a great musical to boot. The characters are super endearing and the complex interwoven backstory holds up so well on repeat viewings. It also has the best ending of any Pixar film, period."
Honky Tonk Freeway,2.5,"Kinda just a bunch of nonsense thrown together with no rhyme or reason, but hey, there could've been worse movies to end the year with!"
Nosferatu,4.5,Kinda like a dark fucked up version of Princess Kaguya. So terrifying at times I started crying. Fun for the whole family
"Night Is Short, Walk On Girl",4,Kinda like if Tomodachi Life was a movie
Oppenheimer,4.5,"Kinda speechless ngl. Glad I decided to see Barbie tomorrow cause this is NOT a feature you want to pair with anything. Gonna spend the rest of the day lying down, trying to process all of this, and crying. Or maybe I'll just play more Pikmin 4 idk"
The Whale,1,Knew I was in for a bad time when the opening credits were dark blue on a black background
The Wrong Trousers,5,"Knowing how Kojima's mind works, it's not impossible that Gromit sneaking around in a cardboard box is what inspired Snake doing that in Metal Gear Solid"
Trolls World Tour,1.5,K-Pop trolls imply the existence of Troll Korea
Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp‚Äôs Adventure,1.5,Lady had like 4 minutes of screentime I think
Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts,3.5,Laughed out loud when they said 'multi-million pound film' like lmao I forgot that was the name of British currency lol Britain is so weird
Spring Awakening: Those You‚Äôve Known,4,lea michele shut UP
The Naked Gun,4,Legacy sequel so good that I'm lowering my score for Happy Gilmore 2 in response
Shrek 2,4.5,"Legitimately one of the best sequels ever made, building upon everything that made the original movie special, while adding its own signature flavor to the franchise. Prepare to feel an unexpected feel."
Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars,4.5,Legitimately the best Star Wars movie since the Disney purchase
Leroy & Stitch,3,LEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JENKINS
Parasite,4.5,"Let's get one thing straight: Parasite is phenomenal. It's a stunning, subtle, and immensely powerful piece on class warfare and the nature of the human condition. It's also a tense, funny, extremely entertaining film that didn't feel its length at all. Go into it without knowing anything if you can; it made my viewing experience all the more exciting.
But with that said...I didn't really like the ending? Tons of details, character arcs, and storylines felt like they were dropped in an instant. And yeah, I know that was the point. But I'd be lying if I said the lack of resolution given to certain characters is something I'm happy about. Like, for how well set up and intriguing Ki-jeong's sociopathic tendencies are, THAT'S what you do with her?
I don't expect my disappointment with the ending to subside with time, but don't let that dissuade you from seeing this film. It's still excellent and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. It's pretty much everything Jordan Peele's 'Us' should have been."
Cinderella‚Äôs Castle,3,"Lightly brushes on a cool and subversive take on the Cinderella narrative, but ultimately plays the story straight far too often. Let her kill some shit!"
101 Dalmatians II: Patch‚Äôs London Adventure,3.5,Like if Bolt was good
Grown Ups 2,1.5,"List of advantages this movie has over the first one
1. No Rob Schneider
2. ..."
Lake Michigan Monster,4.5,"List of movies I've watched 3 times or more this year
1. Whisper of the Heart, my literal favorite animated movie of all time
2. This fucking banger"
Dinosaur,1,Literally the most boring movie I have ever seen in my life
True Lies,3.5,Little uncomfy with Harry's weird treatment of his wife in the middle going completely unchecked and consequence-free by the end (what do you mean the guy who wrote this has been divorced 4 times?) but ultimately the shooty shooty bang explosion scenes in this are sick as all hell and that's what really matters. When he rode the horse into the hotel I literally did that 'guy sitting up in his chair' meme
Inside Llewyn Davis,4,"Llewyn: 'Hey, Mr. Turner, I'm wondering. Would that cane fit all the way up your ass, or would a little bit stay sticking out?'
Mr. Turner: 'What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kil"
Trap,3.5,"Lmao this was so fun, Josh Hartnett gives one of my favorite performances of the whole year. Laughed out loud at so many ridiculous things in the first half and I think that was actually intentional!
The second half lost me a bit once you're forced to take the story and characters seriously (Hartnett has a lengthy scene with another character that would have been soooo good if we actually got to know her in the first half), but overall a great time at the movies! Shyamalan you madman you've won me over again!"
Little Women,4.5,Look all I know is if Timothee Chalamet asked me to marry him I would not fucking hesitate
The Terror,2,Look I want to like Roger Corman movies but William and Hal keep showing me the bad ones
Fate/stay night: Heaven‚Äôs Feel I. Presage Flower,3,Look Shirou I love ya but can Sakura get some screen time in her own damn story
Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning,3.5,"Look, this movie has some bizarre pacing, cute albeit entirely unnecessary callbacks to previous films, way too many characters to balance (very funny for the character you gave nothing to do to say out loud 'there's nothing for me to do'), and a general unmistakable sense that they did not plan out what to do next before finishing the previous film.
BUT the climax was one of the most insane things I've ever seen onscreen and it made my palms sweatier than they've ever been in my life so there is absolutely no world where I could ever call this a bad movie. Disappointing, maybe. But you better believe I joined the rest of my audience in giving it a standing ovation."
Onward,,Looks like another step in the right direction for Sony Pictures Animation :)
Terminator: Dark Fate,2.5,"Lots of good ideas here, Linda Hamilton's performance is great, this is probably the most interesting (albeit underdeveloped) use for Arnold since T2...and yet the main character kinda fell to the wayside a bit, the villain was pretty forgettable, and the visuals reeked of generic CGI gray sludge. Best in the series since T3!"
Frances Ha,4.5,"Love it. A beautiful portrait of a woman trying to find purpose in spite of numerous personal and career setbacks. The use of music to highlight those fleeting moments of happiness and fulfillment in Frances' life was inspired. Black-and-white cinematography didn't seem necessary but it's hard to complain when the film is visually stunning regardless. Gerwig and Baumbach make their voices equally heard throughout the script, and the result is sensational.
Also...I may have a crush on Adam Driver now? More at 11"
The Apprentice,4,Love the idea of Kieran Culkin probably winning the Oscar but in terms of my actual preference...team Ken baby
Shiva Baby,3.5,"Loved the sheer fucking chaos of this movie, I only wish it would have built up to something more climactic by the end. But overall, super fun time"
Hoodwinked!,3.5,Low-key iconic
The Scarlet Pumpernickel,4,Magnificent ending
Open Season 3,0.5,Make it stop
Black Widow,3.5,"Makes some truly incomprehensible editing decisions in its first act but gradually gets better as it goes along. Fun characters, neat action, I had a good time with it. I also probably don't have enough to say about it for a video review oh well"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,4.5,Makes Thor Love and Thunder look like a preschooler made it
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,4.5,"Making it through this DreamWorks marathon was not an easy task. Getting so much shit shoveled into my face the past few days, from Trolls to Turbo to Boss Baby, was a deeply agonizing endeavor.
But goddammit, I stuck it out because I knew this masterpiece was waiting for me at the end of the tunnel. What a fucking tremendous swan song for a great studio and a phenomenal trilogy.
I know there's still technically two movies left in the marathon, but in my heart, this is the DreamWorks series finale. It's been a somewhat rocky road, but films like this one made it all worth it."
Moulin Rouge!,4,"Man this Obi-Wan/Satine prequel hits different
The first half of this is pretty much perfect, from the madcap editing and storytelling to the magnificently realized musical numbers. The second half took a bit of a tumble into bland melodrama (and the duke is kind of a supreme dumbass for not realizing the play was about him sooner) but overall it's a movie that I CANNOT believe I liked as much as I did. I normally hate jukebox musicals but this shit just hits imo"
The Father,4,"Man, fuck Paul"
Manos: The Hands of Fate,1,"Manos: The Hands of Fate was praised for its visual effects, performances, production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Manos: The Hands of Fate was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Avatar (2009) surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after Avatar. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 2017."
Poor Things,4.5,Mark Ruffalo looks way too much like Lalo Salamanca in this
The Phoenician Scheme,4,Marries the adventurous spirit of Grand Budapest with a specific type of warmth and humanity I haven't seen from Wes since Tenanbaums. There's a shot of Benedict Cumberbatch in this destined to become a real all-timer gif
The Warriors,3.5,"Masai is the best character in this by a landslide, dude did nothing but aurafarm"
Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension,4.5,MASTAPEECE. Should not work nearly as well as it does
Shark Tale,5,MAY üëè HIS üëè STINKIN üëè MAGGOT üëè COVERED üëè CORPSE üëè ROT üëè IN üëè THE üëèFIERY üëè DEPTHS üëè OF üëè HELL üëè
The Great Mouse Detective,4.5,Maybe definitely the gayest Disney film ever made
Yonggary,3,"Maybe definitely the most epic bad movie I've ever seen. Could not stop laughing at the 60th time the military guys shot missiles at Yonggary and missed, destroying a bunch of buildings and presumably killing innocent people instead"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,4.5,"Maybe one day I'll actually review this like I said I would!
...eh give me like 5 years or so"
Triangle of Sadness,3.5,"Maybe the biggest nosedive a film has taken in its third act, ever?"
The Monk,0.5,"Maybe the worst and most inept book adaption I've seen since Artemis Fowl
Do NOT bother with this bafflingly worthless experience! Read the book instead! That shit is actually terrifying!"
Dinosaur Hotel,2,"Maybe the worst child acting of all time, bravo Vince"
High School Musical 3: Senior Year,3,"Me before watching this movie: 'The boys will never be back'
Me after watching it: 'Holy shit'"
The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!,4,"Me: 'So this is the movie where the 'Well yes but actually no' line is from, right?'
The movie: 'Well yes but actually no'"
New York Ninja,3,Men will literally become the New York Ninja instead of going to therapy
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget,2.5,Mid 2000s direct to DVD ass sequel
House,4,Might be more jealous of the unabashed creativity and insanity on display in this movie than I am for any other movie in existence
The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story,3.5,Miles faces his greatest adversary yet: the cosmic clone that copies your movements in Mario Galaxy 2
Return to Never Land,3,Missed opportunity to have Captain Hook fight Hitler
Tokyo Godfathers,3,Miyuki's facial expressions were on point
Puss in Boots,3,"'Mom, can we get Rango?'
'We have Rango at home.'
Rango at home:"
Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace,2,"More fun than I remember. The environments and characters either look really good or hysterically bad. Jar Jar and Anakin are annoying but in an amusing sort of way. Watto, Nute Gunray, and Boss Nass are all comedy goldmines. It really is just one of those so bad, it's good movies; all of its blunders are either hilarious or endearing, and I had a great time rewatching it."
Piranha,3,"More insane than I expected, less insane than I wanted"
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,4.5,More like PEAK in Boots amirite
Fantastic Mr. Fox,4.5,Most definitely the orangest movie ever made
To Catch a Yeti,1.5,Most interesting parts were when William was reading the instructions for recipes in the Sonic cookbook
The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),4.5,Mostly fantastic but it's truly insane how much Jean gets shafted
Millennium Actress,4.5,"Movies really are a miraculous thing, aren't they"
Pride & Prejudice,4,Mr. Darcy rocking a V neck in the climactic scene. Peak cinema right there
The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad,3.5,Mr. Toad was the first influencer
Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss,5,"Mrs. Obama, I've done it. I've stopped seal racism."
Grumpy Cat‚Äôs Worst Christmas Ever,2,Much better than I expected!
Vivo,3.5,"Much like every Lin-Manuel Miranda project, it could've used less Lin-Manuel Miranda.
...I did cry at the end tho"
Dune,4.5,"My 1000th Letterboxd log is coming up. You might think I'm gonna line it up so it ends up being Dune 2.
If so you'd be dead wrong"
C.I.Ape,1,"My 600th movie logged on Letterboxd!
Absolute masterpiece that changed my life and watered my crops. Beautiful work of art that must be experienced by all. Truly epic"
Weird: The Al Yankovic Story,4.5,"My 800th log!
Probably the greatest biopic of all time"
We Bought a Zoo,2.5,"My 900th log! I knew I had to do something special for it, which is why I watched peak cinema
Extremely predictable and basic, but also kind of impossible to hate? Like, gosh darn it, Matt Damon is so earnest about buying that fucking zoo that you gotta respect him for it. Glad I was able to find enjoyment in something this schmaltzy considering how the Ted Lasso finale made me want to gouge my eyes out"
My Year of Dicks,4.5,My ace ass thought this was gonna be about a bunch of guys named Richard or something
Muppets Most Wanted,4,"My biggest shame is not seeing this movie in theaters, I'm sorry for failing you Muppets Most Wanted (2014)"
Mission: Impossible III,4,"My favorite so far, with about a million asterisks on that statement.
Love the opening scene, love the villain, love the team camaraderie, the story was exciting, even the romance was sweet dammit! Michael Giacchino the king that you are!
The action set pieces were also great, you know, whenever they weren't blurry as shit with a bunch of shaky cam. The writing was pretty good, except when it wasn't! Luther asking Ethan if he's ever slept with his sister is the exact moment I remembered what Kurtzman and Orci are capable of. Lindsey's message suddenly being viewable at the most plot-convenient time without any explanation as to why was clever foreshadowing for R2-D2 randomly waking up to provide the final piece of Luke's map. Again, it's like poetry, sort of, they rhyme.
Odd that the movie randomly decides to come out against neoconservatism in the last 20 minutes. Like, cool, but it would've been cooler if this was the theme of the entire movie instead of just being thrown in as a lazy surface level Bush-era critique, you know?
Real shame Maggie Q and Laurence Fishburne aren't gonna be in more of these movies. I hope the hilarious way Tom Cruise runs at the end of this comes back."
Northanger Abbey,3,My gf gaslit me into thinking Captain Tilney was played by Alan Rickman the whole time. I was just like 'Huh. Ok sure I can see it' and then we found out that it wasn't him afterwards
Three Thousand Years of Longing,3.5,My heart's desire is to give this 4 stars...but maaaaaan the third act was rough
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,5,My mom wanted to watch a Marvel movie and suggested either this or Captain America Brave New World. Idk do you guys think I made the right choice
The Grand Budapest Hotel,5,"My mom wanted to watch a movie with the family and my dad said 'It's this movie or nothing'
Yeah I agree"
Bad CGI Sharks,1.5,My New Years Resolution is to watch every bad shark movie
Magic Candies,3.5,My sofa and I would no doubt have some riveting conversations about the shit I watch
West Side Story,3.5,"My two favorite Steven Ss (Spielberg and Sondheim) are both insanely talented, and it's impossible to not have a smile on my face during the musical numbers
However...it just occurred to me after 12 years of being a theatre kid that I just don't like this musical's story or main characters that much"
Enchanted,4,Nathaniel do be a simp tho
It‚Äôs Such a Beautiful Day,4,Neat! I am in severe pain now but neat!
Delta Space Mission,3,Need a Tin plushie so bad
Smiling Friends,4,Needed more Alan
Ciao Alberto,3.5,Needed more pasta
Murder Mystery,3,Never before have I been more relieved that a movie was just fine
The Great Muppet Caper,4.5,Never has a movie scene been more committed to the bit than the Piggy's Fantasy water ballet sequence
The Color Purple,3,"Never seen the original musical but I just don't know if the songs added all that much to the story, and the direction made everything feel less engrossing than the original film. Spielberg obviously wasn't a good fit for this story but the man knew how to frame an interesting shot. Great performances here at least!"
The Bob‚Äôs Burgers Movie,3,"Never seen the show before. This style of humor is solid and seems right up my alley for 22 minute episodes, but it gets a bit tiring after nearly two hours. The bunny girl is fun. Why did they forget it was supposed to be a musical"
Color Out of Space,3.5,Nic Cage should be in every horror movie
Cinderella III: A Twist in Time,3,Nice of them to forget Anastasia's character arc but make up for that by giving her a different one
The Little Mermaid: Ariel‚Äôs Beginning,2,Nice to finally get canon confirmation that no one in-universe likes Flounder
Princess Mononoke,4.5,Nintendo really went and based the entirety of Breath of the Wild around this movie huh
Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,2,no
Jesus Christ Superstar,3,"No offense to Judas in this, but we're with the pet hospital down the street, and I understand you have a dying animal on the premises"
Parasite,4.5,'No one can imitate North Korean news anchors like you' gotta be the rarest compliment ever
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,5,No ticket.
Past Lives,4,Nora and I have the exact same laptop so every shot of her using it was extremely disorienting. Like I was seeing my laptop inside of my laptop. Laptopception. The movie was great too I guess
Tarzan,3,"Not a bad movie, but it personally kinda disgusts me. It throws the musical format out the window for horribly implemented samey Phil Collins music that doesn't hold a candle to any other Disney Renaissance soundtrack. Turk is also the most annoying creature on the planet. But there are some good emotional beats and great action to make this still a worthwhile film to watch. It's just not one I revisit, like, ever."
My Big Fat Greek Wedding,3.5,Not a competition but the Greek Orthodox church I grew up in is WAY nicer than that one
Zookeeper,1.5,Not a lot of talking animals in this actually. Who gives a shit about Kevin James's love life!
House,4,"Not a single creative decision was questioned by anyone during the making of this movie, and that's exactly why it's so great.
(Also William told me I had to watch The Muppet Movie before watching this movie. Fuck you William I do what I want)"
The Magic Rosette,4,Not as good as Morbius but whatever
Joe Versus the Volcano,2.5,Not one Joe Mama joke in the whole thing
My Neighbors the Yamadas,3.5,Not quite as good as My Neighbor Totoro but still a worthwhile entry in the My Neighbor Cinematic Universe (MNCU)
Inherent Vice,3,Not really my thing. A devastating blow to the 'PTA makes nothing but bangers' agenda I planned on spreading
Maestro,3,"Not the worst Oscar bait I've seen, though considering how desperately Bradley Cooper wants to win one, it is really funny that Carey Mulligan acts circles around him in every scene they're both in"
My Neighbor Totoro,4,"Not to imply unoriginality, but the cat bus does remind me of Morgana from Persona 5 ü§î ü§î ü§î"
The Goddess of Spring,3,"Not to imply unoriginality, but this does remind me of Cuphead ü§î"
Hawkeye,2.5,Not too late to rebrand and become the TDCU (Tony Dalton Cinematic Universe)
Tarzan II,2.5,Not very good but Zugor deserves the world
A Grand Day Out,4,Note: Wallace and Gromit died on the way back to their home planet :(
Grown Ups,3,Nothing happens in this movie but it's still pretty fun
Memoir of a Snail,4.5,"Nothing like what I expected. Yeah why shouldn't this cute looking stop motion movie rip my heart out of my chest and stomp all over it. Didn't even know that was Sarah Snook until the credits rolled, is there nothing she can't do fr. Yeah I don't know man, I'm empty and drained but also filled with hope at the same time. The kind of movie Animation Is Cinema‚Ñ¢ people will never watch and that's how you know it's great"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,4,Nothing matters. Everything matters.
Hilda and the Mountain King,3.5,"Now give us the She-Ra movie Netflix, don't be shy"
The Secret Life of Pets,1.5,Now I'm just hungry for sausages
Sleeping Beauty,3.5,"'Now shall you deal with me, O Prince, and all the powers of hell' rawest line in a Disney movie fr"
Freaky Friday,4.5,Now that's an Oscar-worthy Jamie Lee Curtis performance
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,3.5,"Obviously confirms that Benedict Cumberbatch would be a perfect fit for Wes's recurring ensemble, but holy shit, can we get Dev Patel in every Wes Anderson movie from now on?"
Nickel Boys,4,"Occasionally difficult to emotionally connect with due to the first person perspective, but equally difficult to deny how bold its storytelling style truly is. How the hell was this not in the conversation for Best Director, Editing, and Sound?!"
The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,3,"Oh no this girl hit her head leaping multiple times and has a concussion, now she thinks she's a time traveller"
Close Encounters of the Third Kind,4,Oh so THAT'S where that scene in Monsters vs Aliens came from
Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier,4.5,"Oh this is on Letterboxd? Cool.
...
...HE FUCKED A TIGER"
Whisper of the Heart,5,Oh wait was I supposed to watch Tales of Earthsea next? Haha oops
Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith,4,Oh who the fuck am I kidding this movie rules lol
Mufasa: The Lion King,1,"Oh you guys REALLY undersold how atrocious this is. Maybe the most abominable, groan-worthy prequel I've ever seen.
DUDE PRIDE ROCK"
Is This Thing On?,3,"Oh, sure, Laura Dern, why don't you go ahead and divorce the guy who's wearing a $5000 suit, COME ON"
Mistress America,4,"Ok but seriously where is Karen's husband? I'm getting very concerned
Little bit messier than the typical Greta/Noah project; the pacing is kinda all over the place and I feel like some extra scenes to flesh Brooke out more would be welcome. However, this movie picks up the slack with its constant witty dialogue and great scene blocking. I had a great time, even though this movie didn't quite hit me with the same relatable feels as Frances Ha"
Shrek the Halls,3,Ok but that dancing roast turkey was fuckin dope
The Muppet Christmas Carol,4,Ok I watched it the normal way. So damn cute! So damn timeless! Why the fuck am I crying over a tiny frog puppet!
Tarzan,3.5,"Ok maybe kinda good actually, but still not as great as it could have been if the characters got to sing through their emotions instead of Phil goddamn Collins doing it"
Re-Animator,4,Ok this was epic
All Cheerleaders Die,1,"Okay everyone, I love giving shitty movies 5 stars as a joke too, but maybe doing it for this one is a bit too far?"
Night of the Living Dead,3.5,"Old horror movies are so fucking cool man, nothing quite like 'em"
Cinderella: Once Upon a Time in the West,1,"Olivia: I'm going to make my review Rango at home
William: We have Rango at home at home
Olivia: letterboxd.com/livmendel/film/cinderella-once-upon-a-time-in-the-west/"
Queen Christina,4,Omg there was only one bed
A Goofy Movie,4,'On The Open Road' walked so 'Another Day of Sun' from La La Land could run
The French Dispatch,4.5,On this rewatch I really came to appreciate how theatrical the blocking and sets are. Complain about the anthology format all you want but I'd argue it's among Wes's best-directed. I've never seen a movie that looks quite like this one before
Moon Knight,3,Once it became a completely different show it got pretty good
Bug Buster,1.5,Once you get past the first 70 minutes out of 90 it's actually pretty fun
The Wedding Singer,3.5,"Once you've seen the other 50 Adam Sandler movies you really start to stomach the expected flaws that are in most of his comedies and get completely drawn in by what a natural and charismatic lead he is. There's a lot of annoying cliches and humor I don't care for here, but I cried at the song he sings at the end so who really cares"
Alien Resurrection,2.5,"One of the dumbest franchise sequels I've ever seen in my life, completely betraying the tone of the original films. I had a fucking blast with it.
It really helps that Alien 3 single-handedly destroyed my investment in anything post-Aliens that happens in this universe. So sure, why not? Why shouldn't every person 200 years in the future act like a ridiculous cartoon character? Why shouldn't a Ripley clone be ballin? At this point all I really wanted was something batshit crazy to contrast the miserable monotony of Alien 3, and this delivered. There are about a million things that don't make sense, but damn it, when you have a cast with good camaraderie who all seem to be having a blast filming this shlocky, tongue-in-cheek, bizarro installment in a long running franchise, how can I complain too much?
To the film's credit, despite how goofy it frequently is, it actually manages to have scenes that are far creepier than anything Alien 3 achieved? (Sorry to get on that movie's case so much, i just despise it more and more with each passing day.) The trap with all the eggs was a delightful fright, and the scene with the other Ripley clones rules; finally, a new and disturbing concept for this universe! Such a shame the scene had to end with an unfunny, unfitting, slightly sexist Joss Whedon quip; want a genuinely exhausting man!
Yeah I don't know, it's a complete tonal departure from the original trilogy and I can totally see why people hate it, but not only is it surprisingly fun, at least it feels like a real damn movie filmed with intent? Like you can tell the scenes were filmed in accordance with a script? It tells a story that doesn't feel Frankensteined together in the editing room? (I'll watch the assembly cut of Alien 3 eventually, I think I just need some time away from the concept of that movie for a while.) The only thing I needed in Resurrection was more of Dan Hedaya's camera-mugging General Perez; i'll never forget his silly visage as long as I live."
Diary of a Wimpy Kid,1.5,One of the emptiest cinematic experiences I've had in a long time tbh
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,4,"One of the funniest and most quotable movies ever made. I just wish the story was a bit tighter and the overflow of characters were trimmed down, but overall, I don't think I will ever stop enjoying this movie."
Hook,2.5,One of the most endearing and likable bad movies I've seen :)
Tammy and the T-Rex,2.5,"One of the most insane concepts for a movie I've ever seen.
I just kinda wish it did more with that concept"
BLUE EYE SAMURAI,5,"One of the most insane, vividly compelling action shows I've had the pleasure of seeing in quite some time, taking well-worn and familiar elements and gradually twisting them in ways that genuinely surprised me across the entire season, while tying everything together with one of the most unique and interesting internal conflicts I've seen a protagonist grapple with. A tour-de-force, too good for Netflix, simply earth-shattering in its sheer quality. Watch it immediately to help ensure it doesn't get cancelled before its story concludes."
The Penguin,4,"One of the rare upsides of the streaming era is that thanks to a corporate desire for an extra Batman-adjacent box to click on Max, we can get exciting, engaging, excellent television that enriches and enhances its cinematic universe. Gonna be thinking about THAT scene in the finale for a while."
Gibby,5,Only caught the last 30 minutes of this but I'm convinced it's the best movie of all time
"tick, tick‚Ä¶ BOOM!",4.5,Only now realizing that this is just a live-action adaptation of that SpongeBob episode where he has to write the essay
Game Night,4,Only unrealistic part of the movie was when they all caught that egg
The Rescuers Down Under,2.5,"Only watched this one out of moral obligation. A resounding meh. It's not even really worth my time to talk about here, I already wrote its portion of the video script and that's all the thought I need to devote to this film for the rest of my life."
Megamind vs. the Doom Syndicate,0.5,OppenheimerStare.jpg
Monster High: Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love?,3,Oscar-worthy cinematography
Before Midnight,4.5,"Ouch
Is this the best trilogy of all time cause it might be"
The Tale of the Fox,4,"Outstanding stop motion by 1930s standards, how did they move like that"
Jim Henson Idea Man,3.5,"Over the past 2 months I've had the pleasure of reading the excellent Jim Henson biography by Brian Jay Jones, which does an absolutely tremendous job of painting a portrait of who this guy is both creatively and personally. I wasn't expecting this documentary to include nearly the same level of detail, but I was nonetheless rather disappointed at how little I got a sense of Jim as a person from this. After a while it mostly becomes an engaging enough doc about his most well-known projects (though The Storyteller and Jim Henson Hour really get shafted - would have liked a lot more elaboration on those!) Ultimately this was pretty solid but I would genuinely recommend the Defunctland miniseries if you want a better fleshed out account of Jim and his career.
To be candid for a moment, I think a large reason I've become so engrossed in learning more about Henson's life is because I relate so heavily to his philosophies regarding work and creative endeavors. To be clear, what I do on YouTube is not even in the same stratosphere as what Henson does, and if you think we're even remotely comparable, you're an idiot. But I've found such fulfillment leading my merry band of editors on creative projects similar to how Jim led his band of puppeteers, and it's only now, after reading about Jim's philosophy on always wanting to keep busy at some new creative endeavor, have I come to terms with my own obsession with never stopping working. Jim had the right idea; if work is fun, fulfilling, and not something you dread or are being exploited by, then it really is the best thing in the world to be doing. I've done at least a tiny bit of work on something every day now for well over a year, and knowing that work all goes towards something at least a couple people out there will enjoy makes every second worth it. I really can't muster that much excitement over the fact that I will soon have 2 million subscribers on YouTube, because the truth is, I would still be making my dumbass videos even if I only had two subscribers.
All this to say, thanks Jim. Your work has greatly inspired me; your work ethic, even more so."
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,3,"Overwhelmingly fine. Man, oh man, this sure is a fine movie. Those characters are definitely very fine. The writing reeks of fineness. Oh by gosh by golly the story sure is fine. It's all fine. I had a fine time watching it.
To be fair tho, Krennic and K-2SO are amazing. The last 10 minutes are sufficiently powerful and dramatic. The action is stellar. Fits very snugly into the canon and compliments A New Hope nicely. I understand why this is a fan-favorite for a lot of people; it takes itself way more seriously than the other Disney Star Warses. Feels much more real.
Like I said, I think it's fine. And that's enough."
Hair Love,4.5,OWWWWWWW MY HEARTTTTTTTT
Paddington,3.5,Paddington!
Guillermo del Toro‚Äôs Pinocchio,3.5,Patchy the Pirate was in this
American Psycho,4,Patrick Bateman is literally just Tohru Adachi
Pocahontas,1.5,Perhaps I treated Ralph Breaks the Internet too harshly. It may be the best Disney movie with Pocahontas in it
Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss,5,Perhaps the best movie
Inception,4.5,persona 5
"Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers",3,Pete got the best ass in all of France
Rocky,3.5,"Philadelphia City Hall is never that uncrowded, I don't gaf if it's 4am and the 70s"
Booksmart,4,"Plays like a mix of Lady Bird and The Nice Guys, which is a surprisingly good combo. So utterly fun and enjoyable with some hilarious characters, great direction, and amazing editing. Some characters could've been set up better and the ending kinda confused me but suffice to say I can't wait to see this again"
Creature from the Haunted Sea,1,Plz direct me to a good Roger Corman movie I haven't seen one yet
Kung Fu Panda 3,3.5,"Po had two dads and he turned out fine!
The weakest one, but still pretty good :)"
Fantasia,4,Possibly the most timeless film ever made
Lifeforce,3,Pretty cool but I wanted more vampire sucking and shit
Marcel the Shell with Shoes On,3.5,Pretty fucked up that Marcel isn't real :(
Peter Rabbit,3,"Pretty fun movie actually. I really enjoyed the protagonist and thought the actor did a great job. His attempts to defeat the villain were also super fun, mostly because of how delightfully hatable said villain was. I guess playing irredeemable unlikable twats, like the borderline terrorist rabbit in this movie, is just one of James Corden's natural gifts."
Persepolis,3.5,"Pretty good adaptation of an exceptional graphic novel. It just suffers from an incredibly rushed pace since they're trying to cram a lot of plot into a 90 minute runtime, which deflates a lot of the dramatic weight from certain story arcs. It's still a good, powerful film, but I strongly recommend reading the book first, if possible."
Rise of the Guardians,3.5,Pretty good but the villain sucks ass. It looks like a car ran over his face. How did his design ever get approved. I expect much higher quality character design from the studio behind Shark Tale
Mulan,3.5,"Pretty good. I think it's a really well-told story, but the comedy doesn't always land for me and the villain, while really menacing, is so disconnected from the hero that it's hard to get invested in them. As a musical, this one is kinda weird; there are less songs than usual, which I guess is owed to the more serious, war-like tone. But still, it kinda feels like there's something missing from this one compared to the other Renaissance films.
Also they didn't have to go that hard with I'll Make a Man Out of You but they did and it slaps"
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,3.5,"Pretty whatever when it's just the first movie again, pretty fun when it's not. Waiter waiter, more Tim Curry please!"
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,4,Probably includes the funniest fight scene ever put to film
Army of Darkness,4.5,"Probably my favorite of Raimi's trilogy because the main character is at his most entertaining here, and while I find this one's insane tonal whiplash and absurd out-of-nowhere concepts to be utterly at odds with the previous two films, they're silly and distinct and memorable and fun enough to make this film the most consistently engaging out of the three to me.
...but enough about Spider-Man 3."
Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode III,3.5,"Probably the weakest one with some jokes that go on way too long, but man Yarael Poof is the best character in this trilogy"
John Wick: Chapter 4,3.5,"Probably the weakest story in the series yet, one that barely feels like it escalates the overall stakes of the series compared to what 2 and 3 did. This wouldn't be a major complaint had this movie been clocked in at around 120 minutes, but unfortunately this chapter comes across as frustratingly bloated, leaving me tapping my foot waiting for the next action sequence to kick in.
But it still gets a positive score because the action was sick as ever and it was cool to see shots with actual colors and personality. On those fronts, this is probably the series' high point. And I like the guy with the dog :)"
The Royal Tenenbaums,4.5,"Probably the Wes film that hits the hardest emotionally, I'm gonna be fucked up for at least a week after watching this one"

Bo Burnham: Inside,,Put this on the background to show Patrick while I focused on trying to beat Undyne the Undying in Undertale. The fact that I only beat her the moment the special was over probably says a lot about how much this special grabs your attention and doesn't let go no matter what. An instant classic.
The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,3.5,Rabbit tries to decorate Pooh's fat ass
The Peanut Butter Falcon,2.5,"Really charming but also kinda boring with some truly awful shot continuity and confusing character motivations. Also I'm not convinced that Dakota Johnson has ever acted before. Also also, I'm not convinced that Jon Bernthal has ever appeared in a movie for longer than 10 minutes.
But on the plus side, Zack steals every scene he's in. Great performance"
The Cabin in the Woods,4.5,Really fucking dope in spite of Joss Whedon's dialogue's best efforts
D√¨di (ÂºüÂºü),4,"Really sweet and enjoyable, though I do wish the mom (the most interesting character) was in it more. Old-school YouTube you will always be famous!"
Howard,4,"Really touching tribute to an artist we lost far too soon. There's not much available footage of his pre-Little Shop life, which makes the front end of the documentary less engaging than it should be, but it's worth it to see the inspiring, tragic story of his life's work."
"Sorry, Baby",3.5,"Really wanted to love this, the performances are great, the direction is good, the story structure is excellent. I guess I just found the dialogue to be a little standard and unengaging a lot of the time, especially in comparison to how gripping the wordless nighttime driving scene was. I think the main character using humor to cope is a smart idea that usually worked, but there are some jokes that landed with a thud (my audience of mostly women was dead silent at the 'We...are women' scene). Don't think I heard a single chuckle during the beating a mouse to death scene either.
Ultimately though, it is admirable in a way how refreshingly messy and honest this movie is. It's nice to see life go on in a film that doesn't take an overwhelmingly bleak approach to this subject matter. I really liked it. I think I would've loved it if any line of dialogue stuck out in an exceptional way."
Over the Garden Wall,3.5,"Reminds me of Infinity Train Season 1! You know, the nice, charming, good one that paved the way for the masterpieces that were Seasons 2 and 3
Though to be fair Infinity Train doesn't have Greg"
Jaws,3.5,Reminds me of Shark Tale (2004)
Synthwave Horror: Nosferatu,2,'Remix culture is an amazing and valid form of artistic expression' and 'this fucking blows' are two statements that can and should exist
Atlantis: The Lost Empire,4.5,Rewatched it already cause its a fucking masterpiece and i'm sorry if society can't see that
La La Land,4.5,"Rewatched this because Dunkey told me to and surprise surprise it's still magnificent. I'm not super into Ryan Gosling's performance but the gorgeous cinematography, breathtaking musical numbers, electric romantic chemistry, and sublime writing perfectly illustrate why Damien Chazelle is an absolute master of his craft. Not quite as perfect as Whiplash, but it does have the slightly better ending. Hell, maybe the best ending I've ever seen in a movie."
Aladdin,4,Rewatching this after Twisted makes you hate Aladdin so much more for how badly he slandered Jafar in his retelling >:(
Robot Chicken: Star Wars,4,"Rey the Death Star construction worker >>>>> the other Rey
Can't believe how well this holds up lmao"
Knives Out,4.5,"Rian Johnson subverted my expectations except it was good this time
Absolutely brilliant deconstruction of the murder mystery genre. Hardly anything played out in the way I expected, and I was glued to my seat the whole time. The excellent script, tight direction, and wonderful performances all come together to make such a pretty picture. I would've liked more development for some of the characters, but ultimately, I realize that they aren't the focus of the story. Which is great; the structure of this film was wildly subversive and unlike any other mystery I've seen. So satisfying.
And holy shit, Ana de Armas is a fucking star now! I'm so happy, I watched her on this Spanish thriller TV show called El Internado a couple years back. I was so excited to see her play a significant role in Blade Runner 2049, and now I'm beyond thrilled to see her as the lead of a feature film. It's so cool to discover someone early on in their career and watch them achieve huge success; the more movies with her, the better!"
Casablanca,5,Rick the coldest mf in fiction
Fate/Grand Order Final Singularity ‚Äì Grand Temple of Time: Solomon,3,"Ritsuka Fujimaru can't carry a movie! Who would've guessed?
But Mash is pretty epic üòé"
Chicago,4,Rob Marshall's immediate falloff as a director after this needs to be studied
Sonic the Hedgehog 2,3.5,Robotnik and Stone didn't even have sex once wtf
Almost Famous,4.5,"'Rock stars have kidnapped my son.'
Not just a highly entertaining movie, but a visceral, palpable experience. A movie that feels entirely authentic in spite of its larger-than-life characters. A real treat of a film that I can't wait to see again."
Love on Delivery,4,Rocky if it was epic
Rushmore,4,Rosemary gave this kid way too many chances like she shoulda just let him fake bleed out in the rain
SK8 the Infinity,3.5,Roy Fire Emblem and his gay lover battle homoerotic vampire Phoenix Wright in a skateboarding competition
Kermit‚Äôs Swamp Years,1,ROY'S OUR BOY!
Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties,1,Ruined my fucking Monday
Aliens,5,"Sacrilege to say, I think I may slightly prefer this over the original Alien. I'm undoubtedly a sucker for emotional cores, which this movie provides in spades, while also being arguably Ripley's most compelling outing as a protagonist. (Despite my disdain for it, Alien 3 is a contender for that honor, though I think the equal measure of Ripley grappling with PTSD and stepping into a surrogate mother role for Newt puts her role in this movie over the top.) There's certainly more to be said, and perhaps I will express it all in the future. For now, let me just ponder why that mf Burke wore flannel to check out the potentially hostile alien planet"
Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle,,Saw Howl's Moving Castle.
Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train,4.5,"Season 1: Whoa this is a fun quirky demon slaying adventure! :D
This movie: üíÄüíÄüíÄüò≠üò≠üò≠"
War of the Worlds,1,Shaking my head to show that I disagree with the aliens deleting my dead wife's Facebook account
A Close Shave,4,Shaun the Sheep getting into Super Mario Maker despite originating in a Wallace and Gromit short is like how Persona got into Smash Bros despite being a Shin Megami Tensei spinoff. In this essay I will
Funny Girl,3.5,She's so crazzzzzzzzy! Love her!!!!!
Schlock,3,Shlock!
Ella Enchanted,4,Shockingly kind of peak. The escalator visual gag had me dying
Make Mine Music,2.5,"Shoutout to Disney for making this as inaccessible to watch as possible
The whale singing opera would never fly in real life"
The Suicide Squad,4.5,Shoutout to that right-wing dipshit who cancelled James Gunn on Twitter so that we could get this banger AND Guardians 3. That REALLY backfired for them huh
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,4,"Sickest damn revenge I've ever seen in a movie. Diabolical.
Shoutout to that guy at the Cinemark who recognized me! I would say you made my day, but like, I watched Furiosa right after soooooo"
Flushed Away,3.5,Simon Pegg and Nick Frost really let themselves go
Frozen II,3,"Simultaneously feels bigger and smaller than the first film. I was really invested in the first hour and the mystery it was building up, but then the story kinda fizzled out into nothingness. Really wastes the vast majority of its characters, both old and new. Stakes feel relatively low due to the vagueness of the story. Songs ranged from pretty good to pretty forgettable; nothing awful tho.
I can't decide which one I like better; nothing in this movie angered or irritated me like the first one, but nothing was really exceptional (aside from Olaf reenacting the first movie). It's a very weird film to talk about, but I think it was still worthwhile unlike Ralph Breaks My Fucking Patience"
Tenet,2.5,Simultaneously Nolan's most ambitious and pedestrian work. Scientists will be studying its unique brand of mediocrity for years to come
Tamala 2010: A Punk Cat in Space,3.5,So damn surreal and atmospheric that you start to forgive the MS Paint ass character designs
50 First Dates,3.5,So damn sweet you forget that a walrus projectile vomited in the first 10 minutes
Mulan II,1.5,"So Mushu is the main villain in this, right? We all agree on that?"
The Hobbit,2.5,So nice of them to make a spinoff movie about Mip from Smiling Friends
Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky,4,So that's where that one clip William used to sneak into my videos comes from
Tall Girl,,So then I said to her 'Taylor Swift? More like Taller Swift' and the entire class laughed. The teacher laughed too and started clapping. Soon the entire school was applauding and the local news came to do a story on me and my amazing joke
Rye Lane,4.5,So this is that buddy Eric you guys keep talking about in your reviews
Obi-Wan Kenobi,3,So uncivilized
A Real Pain,4,"Solidifies Kieran Culkin as one of the most singular, remarkable dramedic actors of his generation. The script could have used more subtlety but Eisenberg's got a lot of potential as a filmmaker!"
Turning Red,2.5,"Some good ideas at play here but an absolute mess of an execution. Idk just watch Lady Bird or Only Yesterday instead.
Edit: Here's my less dismissive and more elaborated upon thoughts: www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEwJBB6AUR4&t=2s"
12 Angry Men,5,Someone's gotta make an edit of this movie where they add Ace Attorney music and sound effects
Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Rogue Nation,4,"Something about the subdued nature of Rebecca Ferguson's performance made her character a bit hard to emotionally connect with, which resulted in this story not drawing me in quite as much. On the flip side, this is best one for Benji and his relationship with Ethan so far by a long shot. Making him the damsel in the third act was a stroke of sheer brilliance. The underwater scene is not only nail biting, it's a great showcase for how thoroughly Benji believes in Ethan even as Ethan expresses visible unease about his capabilities for the first time. Real heartwarming stuff.
I also fw the opera scene so much obviously. McQuarrie's direction is very capable and solid, I think I need to see more from him to fully understand why he got to make 4 of these though"
Pinocchio,3,Something so special about seeing a Disney icon like Pinocchio smoking a cigar
Shrek Forever After,4,"Something tells me I should review this movie...
...eh, nobody wants to see that probably."
Bodies Bodies Bodies,4,Sometimes having stupid characters in a murder mystery is a good thing
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie,5,Sorry about this rating (changes it from 9/10 to 10/10)
The Matrix,2.5,Sorry Keanu I don't like this movie all that much. Maybe the sequels will be better
Ponyo,3.5,Sosuke's mother is the most irresponsible driver I've ever seen lmao
Attack of the Killer Donuts,0.5,"Sounds like it'd be fun
But no"
Duel,4,"Spielberg now: 'I'm a family friendly director!'
Spielberg during the 70s: 'What if a truck driver wanted to murder you'"
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,2.5,"Starts out pretty fun but gets infinitely worse the longer it goes on. There are no characters in this movie; just action figures that are whisked from planet to planet in an excessively manic story that feels like it was written by an 8-year-old. Palpatine sucks ASS in this movie. Everyone other than Rey and Kylo pretty much sucks. It rings hollow, far more than any Star Wars movie that came before it.
And yes, The Last Jedi was better. That movie was half inspiring, half insulting. This one is just a tepid pulp that doesn't hit the highs or lows of its predecessor. It's a lot like Frozen 2, actually, but at least Frozen 2 didn't absolutely shit its pants trying to mimic a far more successful blockbuster from earlier in the year. This movie so desperately wants to be the Endgame for the Star Wars saga. And it fails hard.
It really gets worse the longer it lingers in my mind. Don't waste your time on it. Go see a real movie this holiday season."
The Flintstones,2.5,Still crazy that Halle Berry won her Oscar for this
Dunkirk,2.5,Still does not grab me in the slightest but that's simply a consequence of my incurable aversion to Oscar-nominated war movies and not because of any problems with the film itself. When Cillian Murphy had PTSD I was sad :(
C‚Äômon C‚Äômon,4,Still don't want kids but man do I want to be an uncle now
The Hunchback of Notre Dame,4.5,"Still flawed as hell, obviously, but it's also blatantly clear that no Disney movie has ever or will ever go as hard as this one"
Marriage Story,5,"Still hate the score but I've given 5 star ratings to movies with more flaws than this one, why the hell not. It just gets better and better the more it lingers in my mind"
Luca,4,Still holds up as a wonderful addition to the Pixar canon! Why don't we talk about it anymore?
Barbie,4.5,Still the most fun movie of the year but man some of those real world scenes kinda drag
Heathers,3,"Stilted and awkward in a lot of ways; while it does tell a compelling story and offer a handful of great quotes, it does it with such little energy and poor pacing that it's really hard to get invested.
I should mention that I'm a massive fan of Heathers the Musical, which takes the elements of this film that work and really goes all out in crafting an outrageous, tense, compelling comedy-thriller. This film is more of a novelty as a result; it's not something I'll ever really go back to, but if it's any consolation, the story and characters live rent-free in my brain cause of the musical.
Also holy shit JD looks like a weasel and sounds like a muppet how is it even remotely possible to be attracted to him"
Beauty and the Beast,5,"'Stockholm syndrome this,' 'stockholm syndrome that.' How bout you stock up on four dozen eggs every morning to help you get large"
Raya and the Last Dragon,3,Stop casting Awkwafina in things please I'm begging you
Whisper of the Heart,5,Straight up religious experience seeing this on the big screen. When Seiji picked up his violin it was more hype than Cap picking up Thor's hammer
Hamnet,3.5,Stunning performance from de-aged Hayden Christensen at the end as Hamlet
WALL¬∑E,4.5,"Stunning. Way better for me as an adult than it was as a kid. The fact that Wall-E barely talks and yet manages to be one of the most well-realized and charming characters in animated history speaks volumes. The environmental message is well handled, the romance is believable. The weak villain is really the only thing holding this back from a perfect score."
Alien: Romulus,3.5,"Stupidly well directed and tense for what is ultimately a pretty standard legacy sequel. Multiple sequences had me gripped and temporarily paralyzed with fear (shout out to the anti-gravity acid scene for being particularly unique) before I remembered 'Oh yeah, I don't need to speculate about anyone's survival since I've seen the original Alien.' It feels like a crime to waste Fede √Ålvarez, Cailee Spaeny, and David Jonsson's immense talents on something so predictable and unambitious, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't really effective in a vacuum. I can imagine this being a good entry point to the series for newcomers, but if you have the choice, please seek out the original first.
And seriously, [REDACTED] was bad enough, but did he need THAT much screen time???"
The Pickle Recipe,2.5,Succession for pickle lovers
Bee Movie,2.5,"Such a bizarre movie conceptually, but it's kinda boring in its execution. The plot is haphazard but it's not Shark Tale levels of hilariously incompetent so there's not a ton of ironic enjoyment to be had. Patrick Warburton is the best part but that goes without saying"
The Shape of Water,3,"Such a strong year for movies, such a forgettable Best Picture winner. The direction and score are fantastic; Del Toro and Desplat definitely earned those Oscars, but the story is largely uninteresting and the slow pace doesn't help matters. Michael Shannon's character is kind of a joke and not really intimidating, and even though I love weird stuff in movies I draw the line at fish sex. Oh, and that scene in the movie theatre? Painfully pandering. You're better than that, Guillermo."
Frankenhooker,3,Super crack
The Tune,3.5,Super fun and silly with inventive animation and pretty good songs! Every scene also goes on 5 minutes longer than it needs to!
Whiplash,4,"Surprised I never checked this out before, it's a neat little watch! It's cool to see this prototype version of a scene from the film that surprisingly has most of the same dialogue intact. It also made me appreciate the lighting, editing, and especially Miles Teller's performance in the film even more cause this kid...ain't that great"
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,3,"Surprisingly watchable? It's derivative as hell, the attempts at more iconic Arnold one-liners are cringy, the villain feels less threatening than the previous one, the CGI is noticeably worse than the installment that released 12 years prior, the ending is kind of annoying...but I kinda had fun regardless? Whatever, I'm sure it only gets worse from here."
Shaun of the Dead,4,"Surprisingly works better for me from a dramatic standpoint than a comedic one. It's still really funny, but I'm also incredibly invested in Shaun trying to repair and come to grips with his relationships in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Tons of stellar scenes and impeccable direction make this a blast to revisit."

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,4,"THAT LAST TWIST THO HOLY FUCK
Not quite as hysterical as the first, but it makes up for that by being actually kinda solid emotionally? And the fact that this storyline was constructed in real time during the pandemic is actually kind of mind-blowing. It's just so nice to get a belated sequel that works as a perfect continuation and companion piece to the original for a change."
The Princess and the Frog,3,That shot of Lawrence's huge ass? Cinema
Big Hero 6,2.5,"THAT WAS HIS MISTAKE
If it wasn't for Baymax this movie would legitimately bore me out of my mind. It's really lame as a superhero movie and a Disney movie, and I hate T.J. Miller in this sooooooo much. But y'know it's not awful or anything. Just...10 years behind the curve. Actually, scratch that, Pixar made The Incredibles 10 years before this came out so it's more like 15 or 20 years behind."

The Lighthouse,5,"The closest thing we'll get to a modern-day 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Robert Eggers has given us an absolutely mesmerizing piece of art that begs to be interpreted in a number of ways. I couldn't tell what the hell it meant while I was watching it, and from the sound of things, neither could the other 20-somethings I left the theater with. This is not a film that will appeal to everyone; not in the slightest.
And yet, even though I had very little idea what was happening, I was still mesmerized. The cinematography and intentionally tight aspect ratio made for an effortlessly uncomfortable experience. The sound design, holy shit! It was immensely haunting and I don't expect to forget it anytime soon. The set was great as well; honestly, I'd love to see this adapted for the stage, the script is a great showcase for wonderful directing and acting.
AND THE ACTING! DEAR NEPTUNE, I FORGOT WILLEM DAFOE WAS A HUMAN BEING. He gives the performance of a lifetime and gets absolutely lost in the role. His monologues are equal parts astounding and terrifying. THE LIGHTING ON HIS FACE DURING THAT ONE SCENE GODDAMN.
Robert Pattinson had me worried cause it felt like he couldn't commit to an accent for a little bit at the beginning, but once he gets going, there's no stopping him. Another career-best performance, though he is outshined pretty hard by Willem Dafoe.
It's a terrifying, bizarre, uncomfortable, shocking experience that a ton of people are gonna hate.
And it reminded me why I love movies in the first place."

The Darjeeling Limited,4,The fact that this came out a year after Cars is so funny to me like Owen Wilson played this broken guy trying to physically and emotionally heal from his wounds and reconnect with his brothers a year after stepping into the voice booth and going 'KACHOW' 50 times
The Do-Over,1,"The fact that this miserable joyless sack of shit film has a 2.2 average while The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle only has a 2.3 is insulting. In what fucking universe are they even remotely comparable. You're telling me a swarm of plebians could swarm in at any moment and give the latter film enough negative reviews to bring it down to the level of one of the biggest slogs I've ever seen in my life? What do you people even want anymore. Yeah, I know the CGI looks a bit rough by modern standards. Sure, they probably should have gone with traditional 2D designs for Rocky and Bullwinkle. BUT SO WHAT. The comedy is on point. Joke after joke consistently lands. Robert De Niro poured his heart and soul into getting this movie made, and this is how you treat it? Deeply sickening behavior. Just for that, I'm going to include the Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle in my Adam Sandler ranking despite it not having Adam Sandler in it. I really need to drill into your heads how much better it is than the vast majority of Sandler's filmography that I've had to suffer through already. FUCKING HELL. And that's the thing too, I'm saying this in June. The Sandler ranking isn't dropping until December. You're going to forget about this review over the course of the next 6 months, and then when you finally click on that video, you might find yourself dumbfounded that the Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is included. Hell, imagine being someone who didn't even read this review. What the hell are they gonna think? It doesn't matter dude, this isn't a bit, this is a genuine reflection of my soul. The Adventures of Rocky of Bullwinkle is one of the most unfairly maligned films of the century thus far (assuming the year 2000 is actually a part of this century. Actually my girlfriend and I had a conversation about that just a couple hours ago, funnily enough. She mentioned that the 21st century actually began in 2001, and we got on that subject because we were talking about what my personal game of the century is because of a meme on the Ace Attorney circlejerk subreddit jokingly describing Dual Destinies as the game of the century. As a result, I had to come to terms of the fact that my favorite game of all time, The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, is not actually a game that released in this century. The onus then fell to my second favorite game of all time to be the game of the century, and that would probably have to be Persona 5, but I can't just say Persona 5 is the game of the century, like you understand how embarrassing that sounds, right? I might as well say danganronpa's the game of the century at that point ((I have not actually played Danganronpa)). Anyway if I had to give a more presentable answer then I don't know, Super Mario Galaxy I guess. I don't know if I'm going to get excommunicated from the Persona fandom for this or if they're going to respect me for publicly shunning 5.) Anyway, the adventure of Rocky and Bullwinkle is a true cinematic achievement on par with the Sistine Chapel. I don't think it's going to top the Sandler ranking because, I mean like, come on, punch drunk love and uncut gems are really good. BUT I'LL BE DAMNED IF I LET THE FUCKING DO-OVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE BECAUSE IT FUCKING SUCKS. There was a shot of Luis Guzman's sweaty balls. I forgot the rest of the movie on the drive home."
Shark Tale,5,The fact that we as a society are still capable of producing art this beautiful gives me actual hope for the future. The fascists can never do something like this.
Taxi Driver,3.5,"The first 40 and last 30 minutes are pretty much perfect, but for some reason those middle 40 minutes, in-between the cab ride with Scorsese and the scene where Travis talks to Iris, feel incredibly dull and aimless and I can't figure out why. I'm glad nobody else seems to have this problem at least"
Funny People,2.5,The first half of this is an 8/10!
Phantom Thread,4,"The first half-hour is pretty slow but after that this movie becomes an absolutely engrossing tale of a couple desperately trying to manipulate each other and gain the upper hand in their relationship. I didn't see many of these plot points coming and I was always on the edge of my seat. It's also surprisingly funny and a great, if unconventional, final role for Daniel Day-Lewis."

Aladdin and the King of Thieves,3,The Genie could have solved like 90% of the conflicts in this movie but he was too busy making endless Disney references
Ice Merchants,3.5,The hats ü•∫
Toy Story 3,4.5,"The inverse of Up, where the ending is what's always praised to no end and the rest of the film is kinda forgotten about. The good news is that unlike Up, this is a rich, thoroughly enjoyable story throughout the entire film. I'm a sucker for elaborate prison escapes and this film delivers, complete with a fantastic villain and great jokes. It's not quite as good as 2 but it's still a worthy successor that builds on 2's themes in a beautiful way"
Cowboy Bebop,4,The kind of anime that people who have sex can enjoy

The Match-Stick Flame,3,The kind of movie where you know exactly what its quality will be just based on the poster
The Irishman,3.5,"The last 90 minutes of this movie are sensational.
The first 2 hours are ok.
I really wish I could join everyone else on the hype train with this movie, but I found much of it overstuffed and messy. The direction and cinematography didn't really stand out. The de-aging effects are a little jarring for the first 30 minutes or so, tho they fortunately blend into the background after a while. And I never really got the decision to solely focus on Peggy (if you can call that focus) and not the other three daughters; it would've given one of the scenes in the ending much more impact.
And yet, from the award scene onward, once I saw where Puff Daddy was going with the story, I was totally transfixed. It hit me pretty hard emotionally, and the lack of a musical score really sold the impact. Al Pacino gives the breakout performance of the film, Joe Pesci is also really great, and Don Lino was, again, fine for the first two hours before those last 90 minutes really drove his performance into overdrive.
I feel like condensing this movie into two hours and 30 minutes would make it the masterpiece it so clearly could be. But I'm glad I'm in the minority on this one, and people think it's a masterpiece regardless of its tremendous length. It's really profound to see Puff Daddy making this movie at this point in his career, and I'm glad I got to experience it. I just never want to experience all 208 minutes again."

Amityville Toybox,1,The monkey didn't even kill people! This is a load of baloney.
Moonrise Kingdom,4,The moon doesn't rise once in this whole movie wtf
Hard Ticket to Hawaii,2,The most epic movie ever made
The Truman Show,5,The most fun and lighthearted horror movie ever made
Artemis Fowl,0.5,"The most insulting adaptation since The Last Airbender. An absolutely worthless piece of dogshit that sucks every compelling element out of an incredible book series and deforms it into an unrecognizable pulp. Every character is uninteresting, every directorial choice is incomprehensible, every scene is indescribably awful in its own unique way. Avoid this movie at all costs, especially if you have even the slightest attachment to the original source material."
The Star Wars Holiday Special,1,The most oppressive the Empire has ever felt in any Star Wars media. Andor will just have to settle for second place in this regard.
GetEven,1,The most plotless movie I've ever seen in my life
Feels Good Man,5,The most uncomfortable and uplifting viewing experience of 2020. An absolutely gut-wrenching account of the ongoing battle against hatred and the horror of seeing your creation spiral out of control and become unrecognizable. Gonna be thinking about this one for a long time.
Felix the Cat Saves Christmas,1.5,The nerd kid's voice pisses me off more than it should
Rango,3.5,"The only Animated Feature winner I never saw before starting this project, I must say that I was absolutely stunned by the animation on this one. The lighting, the character designs, the environments, everything just pops and makes for such an engaging visual experience. I was really bored with the story for the first half hour or so but things really picked up after a while, leading to some truly breathtaking action sequences and genuinely funny moments. This is also decidedly NOT a kids movie, which is kind of refreshing. Nothing against kids movies, but it's nice to see a more adult take on a big-budget animated movie for a change."
Porco Rosso,4,The only movie that captures the sheer intensity of the Dogfight mode from Wii Sports Resort
Hercules,4.5,The only possible justification for making a live-action remake of this is to cast Bob Odenkirk as Hades
Happy Feet Two,1,The ONLY reason this isn't a 1/10 is because I like Under Pressure
The Empire Strikes Back,5,The only Star Wars movie to fully explore the ramifications of Yoda's ketamine addiction and that's why it's the best one
Isle of Dogs,3,The only time in recorded history when Greta Gerwig made a movie worse
Ratatouille,5,"The polar opposite of Happy Feet: a rich, intelligent, funny, thought-provoking masterpiece. This is the most underrated Pixar film by far and one of my Top 3 Pixar favorites. It genuinely feels like a smart indie film made for adults, which again, is a testament to Brad Bird's ingenious writing. I will never get tired of revisiting this movie."
Muppet Treasure Island,3,The puppetry was very good!
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,3.5,The Queen is so hung up on Snow White being prettier than her that she creates a potion to turn people ugly. She then uses it on herself? As a disguise to give Snow White a poisoned apple with? Instead of just forcing Snow White to drink the ugly potion and skipping the poison apple step entirely? Smh work smarter not harder
Planet of the Apes,1,The ranking is canceled sorry everyone
Chef,4.5,"The scene where all the main characters poured cornstarch on their balls was a little weird but other than that it was fantastic!
...that sounds like a joke but I promise you that is a real thing that happens in this movie"
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,4.5,The sexual tension between President Muffley and Premier Dimitri tho
Zootopia,3.5,"The Shakira song is laughably terrible but I like this movie a lot otherwise. Great dynamic between the two main characters and some interesting, mature themes for a kids movie. I wish the story was a little more engaging but still very intriguing and fun"
West Side Story,4,The shot of the puddle is so breathtaking and it's such a shame Ansel Elgort had to be at the center of it
Captain America: Civil War,4,"The smartest Marvel movie, but also kind of the dumbest. If Cap had just communicated better with Tony then 80% of the movie's conflict would've been solved. Also Zemo's plan is bonkers. But yeah pretty fantastic in spite of the narrative flaws"
The Devil‚Äôs Carnival,3,The songs and aesthetic were better than Repo but most importantly it was 30 minutes shorter
Space Jam,2,The Space Jam Duology > The Blade Runner Duology
Komi Can‚Äôt Communicate,4,The sweetest anime ever üòä
Fantasia 2000,4,"The toy soldier segment kinda blew, as did some of the celebrity hosts, but hot damn the rest of this was incredible"
In the Heights,3.5,"The tradition of Lin being the worst singer in every musical he writes is still going strong I see
Top notch direction, performances, cinematography, energy, all that jazz. One of the best movie-to-musical adaptations in years. But MAN do they make some changes that undermine some of the best emotional moments in the original musical, and MAN am I mad about that."
Oldboy,3.5,The twist was very obvious but I still gasped
The Wolf House,3.5,The type of movie 'animation is cinema' mfs on Twitter will go their entire life without watching
Whisper of the Heart,5,The video I'm making on this movie is going to kill me with its wholesomeness
Anastasia,3.5,"The villain was entirely pointless to the story but on the other hand In The Dark of the Night is a banger, do you see the dilemma I'm in"
Moana 2,2.5,The water looked worse than it did in the original üòê

Camelot,3.5,They cast the most Italian man alive and said 'Yeah he's French don't question it'
C.H.U.D.,1,They forgot to resolve the main conflict of the movie
Reign Over Me,3.5,They gotta stop calling it Shadows of the Colossus man I know Don Cheadle's character would reasonably make that mistake but Adam Sandler's character should be obsessed enough to know there's only one Shadow in the title
Porgy and Bess,2.5,"They had one set, a goat, and a dream"
They Cloned Tyrone,3.5,They really make you wait for the character named Tyrone in this
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,3.5,They really milked that one joke huh
One Hundred and One Dalmatians,3.5,They should make a whole movie about Cruella or something
Roald Dahl‚Äôs Matilda the Musical,3.5,They shoulda just killed Miss Trunchbull fr

Melody Time,1.5,This entire film has already left my brain
The Secret Life of Pets 2,1,This felt like an eternity
Ocean Waves,1.5,This fucking sucks
Aqua,3.5,This happened to my buddy the cat from Flow
Whisper of the Heart,5,"This hit me so hard in so many ways. I haven't felt this 'seen' by a movie since I first watched Lady Bird 4 years ago. Fuck, man, this is such a special film in so many ways. Every aspiring artist and dreamer needs to watch this. I'm never gonna be able to listen to Country Roads again without sobbing thanks"
Frankenstein,3,"This is a fine enough film on its own and an absolutely shocking watch by 1930s standards, but I did not do it any favors by reading the vastly superior original novel beforehand. This lacks both the pathos and the most haunting passages of the novel; nothing here even comes close to the abject horror of 'I will be with you on your wedding night.' I also think the 'degenerate criminal brain' element of the plot is one of the worst adaptational changes I've seen in anything. It was pretty epic when the unloved lab experiment finally made his first friend in a little girl named Maria though"
Cold Sweat,2,This is a movie
Munchie,3,This is actually a pretty good movie if you get rid of Munchie
Saving Christmas,0.5,This is an extremely funny movie and I would recommend that everyone watch it
George Lucas in Love,3.5,This is cute. I like this. I'm also hardcore procrastinating on my next video
Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,2,This is definitely gonna be #1 on the Betty Thomas ranking
Max Keeble‚Äôs Big Move,2.5,This is definitely gonna be #1 on the Tim Hill ranking
Finding Dory,3.5,This is easily the best non-Toy Story Pixar sequel but y'all aren't ready for that conversation
The Killing Death,1,This is elder abuse
Earth Girls Are Easy,4,This is genuinely so good
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,4.5,This is gonna be so lit when I can watch it at 0.75x speed with subtitles
The Black Cauldron,1.5,This is like a feature-length version of the Zelda CD-i cutscenes except not funny
Scott Pilgrim Takes Off,4.5,"This is like expecting a Christmas present that's really cool but it's something you already own, and instead you get something brand-new that's equally as cool"
Repo! The Genetic Opera,2,This is like if Morbius was a musical
Penguins of Madagascar,3,This is like Minions except not terrible
Little Italy,5,"This is like the third 5-star rating I've given out ironically in the past week but can you really blame me? Frankly, why haven't YOU given this 5 stars? This is a fucking riot of an experience, a film that fully understands how utterly idiotic and terrible it is, and rolls with the insanity throughout its entire runtime. Hayden Christensen, a God Amongst Men, decided to grace us with his amazing fake accent and epic pizza making skills in this bizarre and wonderful psuedo-2000s romcom that absolutely drenches itself in every Italian (and romcom) stereotype known to mankind. It truly has to be seen to be believed; if you think you got the full experience from Drew Gooden's video on it, you are sorely mistaken. This is the hardest I've laughed all year. Fuck, man. I love Little Italy"
Cats,1,"This is literally just a typical production of Cats, y'all are overreacting like hell. 'Weirdest movie ever?' Come on. I'm a theatre kid. I've had weirder shit for breakfast.
That said, Cats is such a shitty musical that a painfully average production of it is still REALLY bad"
Peter‚Äôs Computer - Desktop Cleanup,5,This is one of the best things I've ever seen in my piece of shit life.
Babe: Pig in the City,4,This is so much better than the first film it's insane
Sharpay‚Äôs Fabulous Adventure,1.5,This is still one of Austin Butler's top 8 most popular films on Letterboxd
The Web,5,This is still the best thing he's directed
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,4.5,"This is the best one. A truly moving story about a world unable to adapt to change despite the best efforts of those who try to champion peace. Entire sequences are carried by the score, much like the first film. The character dynamics are incredibly strong, the animation is flat-out insane, the villain is a significant improvement over the last movie, and this is the first one of these movies to make me cry. An absolutely perfect ending to what is easily the best animated trilogy of all time."
The Thing,4.5,This is the first time I've actually seen Wilford Brimley in something that isn't a YouTube Poop
Open Season 2,1,This is the hardest I've ever seen Joel McHale act
Death Note,1,This is the hardest I've laughed in a long time
Arthur Christmas,4,This is the only kids movie I've seen that references the Cuban Missile Crisis and that's how you know it's good
Spider-Man 3,5,This is the only movie I rewatched in preparation for No Way Home
Flubber,1,This is the quintessential example of how not to write a movie
Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro,3.5,This Miyazaki guy is going places
Frozen,3,"This movie and its sequel were the only musical Disney films that my girlfriend didn't want to rewatch, if that tells you anything"
Persona,4,"This movie didn't even have a rowdy group of teenagers reforming society by stealing hearts, what a ripoff"
The Miracle Maker,4,"This movie gave me NIGHTMARES as a kid so I never wanted to rewatch it, but it's actually really cool and artistic and compelling, who knew? Crazy how good Christian cinema can be when it isn't pandering or hateful or embarrassing"
Meet the Robinsons,3.5,This movie had no business being as funny and clever as it was
Wolfwalkers,4,"This movie has the most weirdly inconsistent animation I've ever seen, there are some scenes that are straight-up some of the most gorgeous things I've ever witnessed, and then others where the character designs look like parodies and I can't tell what the focal point of the shot is supposed to be
But it was great otherwise so go watch it"
The Triplets of Belleville,4,This movie has the world's slowest car chase and it's epic
Super Eruption,2,This movie has time travel. It's less interesting than it sounds
The Fox and the Hound 2,2,This movie is 69 minutes long
Iron Man 2,2,"This movie is actually pretty solid for a first hour, but after Tony Stark pees in his suit the movie enters a downward spiral that it never recovers from. Still, if this is the weakest MCU movie, we could be doing a lot worse."
Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,4,This movie is amazing except for the parts that suck but those parts are extremely fucking funny
Jesus Christ Superstar,3.5,"This movie is goofy as sin in so many ways, and while it works for certain songs (Simon Zealotes, Herod's Song, etc.), it really betrays the tone in other areas. Nothing quite like getting wrapped up in the drama of Judas receiving his silver pieces for betraying Jesus, only for the film to suddenly cut to jet planes flying overhead. It's...a lot, but it is, at the very least, consistently entertaining with a fairly good balance of humor and drama. Happy Good Friday my fellow Greeks!"
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,4.5,"This movie is Raiders, but better in like, every way. It's exciting, it's super funny, you buy the emotional connection between Indy and his dad, the villains are great, the action is superb, Marcus Brody is such an endlessly entertaining buffoon. Just watch this movie if you enjoy fun. It's the best Indiana Jones movie and one of the best Spielberg movies."
The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,3.5,THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNY ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MINDS
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,4,"This movie RULES! It remains just as exciting, impactful, funny, and magical as it was 4 years ago. The New Hope rehashing surprisingly works for me, because the script and direction evoke a very different tone to that of the original Star Wars even though they follow the same plot beats. Sometimes the movie bends a little too far backwards to justify a New Hope parallel (Starkiller Base is the lamest shit ever) but for the most part, I'm really on board with this one.
These characters are instantly lovable and relatable. Rey, Kylo, Finn, BB-8, etc. are all delights, and this movie gives me everything I could've wanted out of an older Han Solo before wrapping up his story in an emotionally resonant way. Also, I'm glad that, aside from Phasma, this movie doesn't treat the First Order as a joke. More on that later...
Filmmaking wise, this is leaps and bounds ahead of most big blockbusters. Great cinematography, striking editing, wonderful practical sets. J.J. proves time and again that he's an excellent sci-fi director.
This isn't the most ambitious Star Wars film, but it didn't have to be. It's the perfect companion piece to the original trilogy and I thoroughly adore it. Besides, any minor issues or plot contrivances are gonna get explained in the next movie, right? RIGHT?"
Promising Young Woman,3.5,"This movie's pretty neat!
I wish the ending wasn't terrible tho!"
Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie,1,"This shit is so ass! My friends were logging it and I felt left out so I watched it too, in case you needed an answer to the question 'Would I jump off a cliff if all my friends were doing it'
A Sandy AMV of Pink Pony Club by Chappell Roan would go kinda hard ngl. I ain't making that cause that requires looking at this bitch ass movie more. The onus is on you, the reader. Make that for me"
The Muppets‚Äô Wizard of Oz,1.5,This should be the easiest movie in the world to make good and the fact that it's this bad is a genuinely impressive feat
The Bad Guys 2,,This time I'm not even giving you guys the score
Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode II,3.5,This trilogy has the best characterization for Boba Fett of all time lmao
The Lobster,4,"This was an extremely smart, tightly-written, borderline perfect movie for about the first 75% of its runtime. But that last 25% was...kinda clunky? And didn't make great use of this incredibly creative premise all that well? And the score got really repetitive after a while?
It's still a great movie, but it's always a little disappointing when it seems like you've got a new all-time favorite on your hands and instead you're left with just a regular great movie. If the first act was the weak part, I might be singing a different tune. But still, pretty great overall"
The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,2.5,This was like 5 different movies at once and the only good one was Nick Cage and Pedro Pascal vibing
Abominable,3,This was really excellent for like 25 minutes and then it just turned into a worse version of Up
1917,4,"This was really good but I could never shake the feeling that I was watching a 2-hour cutscene and never getting a chance to actually play the game.
At least Roger Deakins will be a 2-time Oscar winner now."
You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,3.5,This was sweet! I'm beginning to think Adam Sandler might be Jewish
Robot Jox,3,This would be so good if it had a budget
The Satellite Girl and Milk Cow,2.5,This would honestly be one of my favorite movies ever if the people making it actually knew what they were doing
Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu,3.5,This. Movie. Is. BONKERS. Suffice to say I will have a full review out in a couple days but in summary I really really really liked it
Lava,4,Those two volcanoes banged and gave birth to Te Fiti. This was all a prequel to Moana
Winnie the Pooh,3,Tigger is the Kramer of the Winnie the Pooh universe. I will not elaborate
Alice in Wonderland,4.5,Tim Burton's live-action remake found dead in a ditch

Joker: Folie √† Deux,1.5,"Todd Phillips makes Worst Jukebox Musical Ever, asked to leave musical theatre"
Beauty and the Beast,5,"Tonight I watched a goddamn 4 hour cut of all 3 Beauty and the Beast movies stitched together
It was maybe the hardest thing I ever had to watch? 3/10, it is insane how the full story is so much less than the sum of its parts."
You‚Äôre Bacon Me Crazy,1,Top 1 best movie titles of all time
Suburban Sasquatch,1,Truly the most epic movie of 2004 about a suburban sasquatch
No Disrespect,1.5,Tubi is perhaps the greatest gift to humanity
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,4,"Turns out the best Batman stories are the ones that actually deconstruct his philosophy and him as a character in general, who knew"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,,uh
Nope,4,Um if it's so hard to get footage of this thing then how did the cameraman of the movie get footage of it so often ü§îü§îü§î
I‚Äôm Still Here,4,Unbearably devastating. I can see why every single one of my Brazilian fans wanted me to watch this
PAW Patrol: The Movie,0.5,"Unwatchable neolib claptrap. Genuinely ungratiating lowest common denominator pop fascism Neolithic capitalist trash, leaving a turgid atmosphere of phonetically unremarkable serendipity in its wake. Culture is dead and the ingrates who support unfathomably inert and artistically barren shovelware such as this must never be allowed to procreate. Cannot wait for said degenerates to share this review and write actual responses to a bunch of random buzzwords I threw together with no rhyme or reason. I have not actually seen this film."
Star Wars,4.5,"Usually I don't rewatch movies unless I'm preparing to make a video on them, or I'm showing them to someone who hasn't seen them before.
Tonight I just said 'Fuck it, I'm watching Star Wars by myself for no reason other than it being Star Wars.'
We all deserve a treat sometimes.
Star Wars fucking rules."
Despicable Me,3.5,"Vector is the reason I work out. I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. He asks what I do. I say I loved him in Despicable Me. He laughs. I get my drink.
'Well, see ya,' I say and walk away. I've got his attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Vector? He touches his neck as he watches me leave.
Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, he finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette.
'Got a spare?' he asks.
'What's in it for me?' I say as I hand him one of my little yellow minions. He smiles.
'Conversation with me, duh.'
I laugh.
'What's so funny?' he protests.
'Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the egos?'
'You get used to it,' he says, lighting his cigarette and handing me back the lighter.
'What would you do if you weren't a supervillain?' I ask.
'Teaching, I think.'
'And if I was your student, what would I be learning?'
'Discipline,' he says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. 'Where are you from?'
'The moon,' I say.
'Oh wow. That's lovely.'
'It's ok,' I admit. 'Not everything is to my liking.'
'What could possibly be not to your liking on the moon?' he inquires.
'It's the place you got stranded on in Despicable Me (2010), when you suffered the WRATH OF GRU'"
Howl from Beyond the Fog,3,"Very cool and atmospheric, though I think the expressionless puppets held it back for me and prevented me from getting truly invested. I'd love to see a higher budget (and perhaps feature length) version of this with stop motion animation that allows the characters to have actual facial movement"
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,3.5,Very fun but how do you cut that many songs from the original musical and still sleep at night
Ne Zha,3.5,"Very fun! Couldn't help but feel like most aspects of the film, from the villains to the central friendship to the abrupt ending, would have benefitted from another draft. Even so, a nice time with some unexpectedly killer fight scenes. Excited to see the sequel which is the highest grossing animated film of all time, apparently!"
A Different Man,4,"Very fun, very Kaufman-esque. Adam Pearson radiates a blinding level of charisma and Sebastian Stan in the final scene of this movie specifically is the hottest I've seen a man look in a while"
Toradora!,3.5,Very good when Taiga is not beating the shit out of Ryuji
Pinch,3.5,Very impressive directing/producing/writing/starring effort from Uttera Singh. Spread its story out a little thin but there's some truly excellent stuff here
Following,3,"Very much feels like a student film trying to emulate Nolan's style, so in other words, the most 'first directorial feature' movie to ever be a first directorial feature"
Frankenstein,4.5,Victor actually tries to be a father in this version and he's somehow even worse at it than usual
Strawberry Mansion,3.5,"Wacky, batshit, stunningly sincere. Wasn't a fan of everything but it's got the kind of unbridled creativity movies in general could use more of"
Surf‚Äôs Up,4,Wait what the fuck why is this movie so great
Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion,,Wake me up when the last two episodes of the show come to theaters

The Wrong Trousers,5,Wallace not recognizing the penguin until he took off his chicken hat has extreme Dr. Doofenshmirtz energy
Snack Shack,3.5,Wanted a slightly more interesting conflict in the second half but overall an immaculate vibe to this one! Like if Challengers was just a chill hangout movie
May December,4.5,Wanted to crawl out of my own skin for basically the entire runtime
Lightyear,1.5,Was curious if this was still ass so I threw it on in the background while playing Pikmin. Boy is it ever still ass! Taika Waititi should be banned from voice acting!
Megalopolis,3,"Was dazzled and bewildered in equal measure by this. I'm not one of those squares who needs a coherent plot or a sensible magic system in order to get into a film like this; I was absolutely captivated by multiple sequences, in fact. However, I couldn't help but feel a bit let down by the lack of meaningful character progression in this. It feels like Cesar never changes over the entire film's runtime no matter what he goes through, and this is a major contributing factor to the film's conclusion feeling so hollow and unearned. I know, I know, this isn't the kind of film I should try and apply storytelling logic to, but I feel like I would have enjoyed it more on the whole if it leaned into the abstract entirely and didn't even bother with a narrative. Ultimately however, it's not about what I want, and I'm glad we got to see an old man's completely uncompromised and kooky vision unfold on the big screen. Every possible opinion on this film is indeed correct; there's enough brilliance and utter dogshit to swing the pendulum in either direction. Aubrey Plaza MVP, I legit didn't know she had that performance in her."
Cinderella II: Dreams Come True,2.5,Was disappointed to find out that Lucifer was not canonically dead after his fall at the end of the first movie
Punch-Drunk Love,5,"Was gonna rewatch this at the end of the Sandler marathon but I kinda couldn't wait. I have not been able to stop thinking about this one. Real life-affirming shit. Uncut Gems has 'bumpable up to 10 on rewatch' potential so there's still a race for Sandler's best movie. But I don't know, I think it's kinda decided already"
Colossal,3.5,Was not expecting to be intimidated by Jason Sudeikis of all people today
Fate/Apocrypha,2.5,Was torn between a 5 and a 6 but the mere existence of Jack the Ripper drags this down to a 5. Needed more Shakespeare.
Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier,5,"Was working on a video on this when it finally hit me
This is one of the best musicals I've ever seen in my life lol"
Batman,3,Wasn't sure why Jack Nicholson got top billing in this movie until I watched it and realized Joker was the main character
The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special,4,Watch Kevin Bacon be crucial to the plot of Volume 3
Away,3,"Watch out Phil Nibbelink, there's a new animator who made an entire film by himself in town
Didn't grip me the whole time but I appreciate the look, feel, and overall ambition!"
Saving Private Ryan,5,Watched at a Midas auto repair shop (it was playing on the TV at full volume)
Whisper of the Heart,5,"Watched it again, this time with the original Japanese audio.
I don't think it's the best Ghibli film, but it's absolutely my favorite. I feel like I've been waiting for a movie like this all my life."
Mickey‚Äôs Rival,,Watched it for Mortimer (ha cha cha)
Morbius,5,Watched the first 10 minutes of this and decided it was all I needed to see.
Mad Max: Fury Road,5,"Watched this for the first time in years, completely forgot that one of Joe's henchmen just looks like The Penguin"
Exit Through the Gift Shop,4,"Watched this in film class and my God this is BONKERS. Easily the most insane documentary I've ever seen. Is it real? Was it staged? Who cares?
Thierry Guetta cements himself as the Tommy Wiseau of the art world, and his story is as hilarious as it is thought-provoking. I'm gonna be pondering the nature of art criticism and subjectivity for weeks to come after seeing this. Great stuff."
Bottle Rocket,3,"Watching such an unstylized Wes Anderson film is so weird, like it feels like I've stumbled onto some illegal footage I was never meant to see"
Megamind,4.5,Watching this after the Doom Syndicate is probably how Lazarus felt after Jesus brought him back from being dead
Belfast,1.5,'We had a neural network watch 100 Best Picture nominees and then asked it to create its own'
Turbo,1,"We have officially reached the 'let's just get this over with' phase of the DreamWorks marathon. This was truly fucking agonizing. Every character, relationship, and story beat feels artificial and hollow. Even the racial stereotypes from Shark Tale are back in full force. It's a completely worthless experience; basically, the DreamWorks equivalent of The Good Dinosaur. Gonna go rewatch Ratatouille to wash the taste of this piece of shit out of my mouth"
The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,3,We need a spinoff about Willem Dafoe's character pronto
Look Back,4.5,"We were gonna make so many things together. We were going to put out art that would matter to people and affect their lives. We were going to do it together. And now here I am, trying to commit to and focus on making something, anything. But it's just so hard. I need him."
I Saw the TV Glow,4,"Weird that I happened to watch this movie on Election Day, when it depicts an Election Night in the opening. Weird that I happened to watch a movie with a Tux and Fanny cameo mere hours after I watched their own movie. Two odd coincidences, weird little quirks of time moving fast. I'll try not to think too hard about it."
The Week Of,2,Weird that this is the second Sandler movie I watched in a row to feature Don't Stop Believing. Huh. Anyway this movie is not very good
Sandy Wexler,2.5,Weirdly conflicted on this one. For every shockingly sincere and kind of sweet moment there's Rob Schneider in brownface to balance it out
Ride Your Wave,3,"Weirdly straightforward for a Masaaki Yuasa joint, with a kinda dumb third act, but hey, any bonus grief counseling I can get through movies is nice üòÅ"
Conclave,2.5,"Well acted, decently well shot, staggeringly unengaging. I see the vision of other users on this site highlighting how juicy and petty the infighting is in this movie, and I fully think it should have leaned into a more lighthearted tone. The election of a new pope feels inconsequential in this despite the movie's consistent, suffocating attempts to paint it as The Most Important Event In The History Of Mankind. Nowhere is this more evident than with the unbearable score; it's hard to imagine its composer having ever watched the movie he was working on. It's this exact tonal disconnect, this attempt to feel weighty and significant, that makes the film ultimately reek of disposability. I liked it better than Berger's previous film."
Bo Burnham: The Inside Outtakes,4,"Well, well, look who's inside again."
The Ridiculous 6,1,Well. At least Huell was in this
What We Do in the Shadows,4,WE'RE üëè WEREWOLVES üëè NOT üëè SWEARWOLVES üëè
Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn‚Äôt Happen,2,"We're going back in time to 1776 to get Ben Franklin to make turkeys the national bird
That's right, we're going back in time to 1776 to get Ben Franklin to make turkeys the national bird"
BƒÅhubali: The Beginning,3.5,"What a great movie, I sure hope it doesn't have an unengaging hour-long flashback sequence at the end"
Jojo Rabbit,5,"'What did they do?'
'What they could.'
I sobbed all the way through the credits. I couldn't even begin to compose myself. I was absolutely shaken to my core. And once I was able to find my footing and exit the theater, the first thing I did was buy a ticket to see it again.
Jojo Rabbit is a story of overcoming blind fanaticism and indoctrination, showcasing that monsters aren't born; they're made. They're manipulated. The transition Waititi's Adolf Hitler goes through over the course of the movie, from quirky companion to the furious, foaming-at-the-mouth espouser of hatred we know him as, illustrates the inner turmoil Jojo experiences as he grows to defy his twisted 'conscience'.
This is supported immensely by the fact that Roman Griffin Davis is an absolute star in the making. He nails every single comedic beat and dramatic moment with equal mastery. The performances are exceptionally great across the board, with Thomasin McKenzie and Scarlett Johansson being the two strongest supporting players. Both work wonders in their roles (and tragically share the screen too infrequently), providing Jojo with a more optimistic view on life than the twisted version he was taught.
The buffoonery of the Nazis is a point of contention among many reviewers, and their disdain for this aspect of the film is not unwarranted. However, I thought they were sufficiently portrayed as evil fanatics and that the jokes at their expense were accordingly funny. The comedy mostly worked for me; for every joke or visual gag that didn't land, there were five more that made me chortle both times I watched the film.
But shockingly, the sheer dramatic heft of the movie was its strongest attribute. I can't remember a film that moved me to tears to the same extent as this one. Jojo simply was an innocent boy indoctrinated into a worldview of hatred; he didn't deserve to be, and the rift between he and his mother was palpable and raw. Then we got to THAT scene, which has already cemented itself as one of my favorites in all of cinema.
Visuals, motifs, lines of dialogue, etc. are expertly reincorporated over the course of the movie, but nothing holds a candle to the magnificence of the ending, which is a strong contender for being my all-time favorite. Equal parts quirky, brilliant, and beautiful, it left me laughing and sobbing simultaneously, all while I came to the realization that no one else could have done what Taika did with this film. This is the masterpiece he was destined to make.
To summarize, Jojo Rabbit isn't a movie about the Holocaust. It isn't about the many atrocities committed by the Nazi party. It is simply about one little boy's journey to reject evil and allow love to triumph over hatred. This is what it chooses to be, and this is how I'm judging it. And to say it succeeds would be an understatement. It's the kind of movie that I'm never going to forget as long as I live; something so ludicrous, and yet, so unflinchingly honest."
A Silent Voice: The Movie,4.5,"What does it mean to live with your mistakes?
What does it mean to feel remorse?
What does it mean to want to make things right?
Can you ever really make things right?
Will anything ever take away the shame?
The pain?
The remorse?
You lost a piece of yourself all those years ago.
Will this finally fill the hole?"
Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas,2,"What happened to Figaro's corpse when everyone turned human again? Did his dead organ body turn into a mangled human body? I have questions
EDIT: I got the organ's name wrong I aint fixin it"

Bigfoot‚Äôs Wild Weekend,1,WHERE THE FUCK WAS BIGFOOT FOR MOST OF THIS
Baby Assassins: Nice Days,4.5,"WHERE THE HELL DID THIS ONE COME FROM? Right from the get-go it's easy to tell what a staggering directorial improvement this is over the first two, on top of having an actual consistent story with genuinely high stakes and danger, without sacrificing the quirky charm of our two protagonists. The best of the trilogy by far; the other two are cute and fun, but for a series that's basically 'John Wick meets iCarly', I'm glad we finally got an installment that took more from the former instead of the latter."
Rocketman,3,"While BoRap was one straight line of quality, this film is one of soaring highs and dull lows. Anytime it goes into a musical sequence, it's enthralling with amazing filmmaking and performances. Anytime it isn't, it's...kind of dull? There's some good drama towards the end but for the most part I was just kinda waiting for the next musical number the whole time.
Still better than BoRap"
Ace Attorney,3,"While extremely faithful to the original game in terms of its tone, look, and storyline, I feel like the most of the game's character work was lost in translation. The condensed time spent with these characters means the loss of some great character arcs for Phoenix, Maya, Edgeworth, and Gumshoe. I feel like I barely know who these people are, since the plot is always the focal point of the film and there's little time to breathe.
Coming fresh off the game, I followed the plot well enough but I feel like there are so many details that just aren't explained particularly well, plus a lot of drawn-out sequences. The direction and cinematography were solid but could have veered a little further into the bizarre. Ultimately, it was cool to see the characters in live-action, but I feel like Ace Attorney would be better suited for a miniseries than a regular film. Still, an above-average attempt."

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,4.5,Wish I could erase this film from my mind just so I can watch it for the first time all over again
The Tale of The Princess Kaguya,5,"With you, Sutemaru, I might have been happy.
Absurd that Isao Takahata's name does not carry the same level of reverence and awe from the general populace as Hayao Miyazaki's. I suppose it comes down to his masterpieces being fewer in number and far less marketable. Regardless, this is the ethereal, untouchable magnum opus of an artist at the pinnacle of his career. The best animated film I have ever seen in my entire life, and quite frankly, it isn't close."
The Grinch,1,Wooooooooooooooo you just keep hitting the home runs Illumination
Tales from Earthsea,1.5,"Worse than I expected tbh. An agonizing failure at worldbuilding with the dullest characters and story to ever be featured in a Ghibli film. Hilariously lifeless direction. Princess Mononoke had more levity than this trash. I wanted it to be over from the 15 minute mark and it just kept going for an eternity. To be fair Willem Dafoe is good in it.
I feel bad for Goro Miyazaki; like, he clearly wasn't ready to take on a feature film and I can only imagine the pressure he was under to make something up to the studio's (and his father's) usual standard. I pin the blame on the studio for allowing him to take on this project; however, for his first feature, it honestly could've been worse.
I do not anticipate being this forgiving to Earwig and the Witch."

How to Train Your Dragon,4.5,"Wtf why this movie so damn good? It's perfectly paced, incredibly powerful, striking from an animation perspective (save for a poorly rendered character here and there). Why did I never like this as a kid? It's the best DreamWorks movie of 2010, the year that also gave us Megamind and Shrek 4. HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT OUTPUT OF QUALITY IN THE SAME YEAR. SHARK TALE HAS NO EXCUSE ANYMORE"

Whiplash,5,"Yep, still the best movie I've ever seen.
#TerenceFletcherIsOverParty"
Dune,4.5,"Yes yes YESSSSSSSSSS
Denis Villeneuve has this way of bypassing my absurdly short attention span in a way no other filmmaker can. Every scene he shoots is so compelling through its presentation and atmosphere that its overall relevance to the larger story is a moot point. I was glued to my seat during the entirety of what was arguably 2 and a half hours of setup. But when the setup is this rich and nuanced and thoroughly engrossing, how can I complain?
Definitely feels like the second part will be the more interesting story (idk tho I've never touched the book), and with a foundation this strong, I'm going to be in sheer agony waiting for the sequel. Blade Runner 2049 is still my favorite Villeneuve film but this is a close second. Fucking hell, this movie slaps."
