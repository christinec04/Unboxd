"The Brutalist",5.0,"Completely not what I expected. Visceral and brutal. Year’s biggest surprise."
"Moana 2",0,"I was nervous going in as Moana 1 is so iconic, and expectations were dampened when it seemed the film was going direct to streaming. I needn't have worried! This movie is its own thing, it's an ensemble piece with more of the previous film's crowd pleasers (chicken, pig and coconut!) and David Fane and Rose Matafeo who steal the show with their comedic chops. Special mention must go to demi-villain Awhimai Fraser who totally rocked and had my fave song (in a crop of soon to be tik tok ear worms globally!). Haven't seen Reo version yet (Awhimai is in both!) but it's at the top of my must-see list now! Kia Kaha to M8 - the Magnificent 8 of Moana 2!"
"Megalopolis",0.5,"Half a star for Wow Platinum. This film tries so hard but it just falls flat. The Roman decadence is nowhere to be seen, where is the bacchannalia and the cornucopia? Nothing visceral this way comes. I almost walked out but my interest piqued after the 'talk-to-the-screen' scene (I think it should be audience participation with the line printed on your ticket!). From there, I enjoyed the fever dream moving image art installation heading to a stumbling closure. Biggest lost opportunity: the Megalon. So meh. Couldn't it have got out of control and started eating the city ala le blob? Injected into humans turning them into sex-starved megalonian robots? (hinted at!) Oh, and the Megalopolis was only a Metropolis. Where or where was the Mega? (and I don't have a clue what all the Maga hints meant, either...maddening.)
Oscar nom for Aubrey Plaza, please."
"Leave the World Behind",4.0,"Netflix gets very Meta with a parable on physical media (?) when the digital world comes crashing down (right down to the now-redundant Netflix logo on a remote).
My digital world came crashing down in February 2023 when Cyclone Gabrielle took down net and cell phones for a week in my remote, rural community in New Zealand so its only apt that I watched this day-and-date global streamer via my new supposedly future-proof Starlink satellite dish connecting to Mr. Musk's satellites in space, the same satellites that apparently will be controlling self-driving Teslas that play such a freaky doom-laden role in the film.
That Friends plays a role in the plot is made even sadder with the recent passing of Matthew Perry, and one can only think could this year have been even shittier? And yes it can as this 2 hour drama-melodrama (it's not about race, it's about diversity casting!) burns my brain in 2023's closing days.
By the end of the film, I've decided I want to stockpile all my DVDs, burn all my CDs (onto a hard drive!), rush out and buy a generator ($299 at the hardware store) and fill my cupboards with cans of food.
(Yikes! That's what I'm actually already doing, my cupboards full to bursting from the local climate-crisis era welfare relief drop-off, for my, um, doomsday era yellow-stickered home, in the other corner of my home the film archive digitisation box donated to my community marae with muddy handprints from when it was lifted out of rising flood waters, this is all awfully meta-fantastic...)
Of course the reality is with AI we are actually hurtling even *faster* down the self-obsessed tech connected rabbit hole, one that leaves us lost without GPS as we pull over at gas stations that no longer sell maps because map reading is no longer a skill we need as the gentle voice in our car tells us where to go and how to get there, our hypnotic self-obsessed attachment to tech made so evidently clear in a masterful set-piece in the car early on in the film (all four family members in their own synaptic-feedback rewarding cyber-bubbles).
Seeing this film makes we want to read the book, I better rush out and buy a Kindle for Christmas, so I can download it and read it on the beach and in between chapters gaze out to the horizon waiting for the doomsday boat to arrive in 2024 which no doubt will be even scarier.
The world didn't end when the Net went away for those fateful six days, but it made me think seriously about what's left if it goes again. So I better get back to tending to the dead media collections of my Dead Media Museum: DVDs, CDs, printed maps, travel guides, VHS tapes, cassettes, records, Blu-Rays, art..."
"The Delinquents",3.0,"A surreal slow cinema bank heist movie. Say what you want about this movie, but the premise is pretty unique."
"Single All the Way",2.0,"Two stars, one for Kathy Najimy and the other for Jennifer Coolidge. Light fun entertainment for Xmas."
"Happiest Season",3.0,"Three stars for Aubrey, two stars for Kristen. Alas minus two stars for MacKenzie's character! (though the actress is great and the 3 sisters are a perfect trio!)"
"Next Goal Wins",4.5,"Taika wins! Standing ovation at TIFF well deserved. The kind of cross cultural feel good comedy we need right now. Taika wins! (Sept 2023)
December 2023 Reflections:
Next Goal Wins
Written and directed by Taika Waititi (Te-Whānau-ā-Apanui)
Seen by Leo Koziol at Princess of Wales Theatre, Toronto at TIFF
This year I had a fantastic dream that I was at one of the biggest film festivals in the world and everyone was unreservedly applauding a big Polynesian-Samoan sports-comedy, cheering on an Oscar-winning Polynesian-Māori filmmaker as a big Samoan bus sat parked on the street outside and billboards for the film lined the street for three blocks and the star of the film was a trans-Samoan actress playing a real life trans-Samoan soccer star who was there in real life.
Except it wasn’t a dream, it was real, and I was at the Toronto International Film Festival for the world premiere of Taika Waititi’s Next Goal Wins. There was a native blessing, the audience gave the film a one minute standing ovation, and we even got official Next Goal Wins coconut milk ice creams afterwards. The critics (and US-box office) may have been less kind to Waititi’s latest film, but I don’t care one bit, I know our people will love it. As a lifelong champion of Polynesian and Māori cinema, being at this premiere and feeling the love for Taika’s storytelling was a dream come true. I can die now. Thank you. Kia ora."
"Barbie",0,"OMG I want the Letterboxd algorithm!"
"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King",4.0,"The movie that changed Hollywood and transformed Aotearoa New Zealand forever. From 2001 to 2020, New Zealand experienced a tourism boom that in large part can be considered the result of a 'Middle Earth' inspired transformation of the places and landscapes of our country from north to south. 'Hobbiton' in the Waikato is considered a compulsory tourism stop; the Southern Alps are as famed for appearing in this trilogy as they are for their sheer, remarkable, sky piercing beauty; and Wellington is now 'Wellywood' with Gandalf atop a giant Native hawk permanently on display in the airport (Wellington is home to both Weta Studios and Wingnut, where all six LOTR films were made and also much of the 2 Avatar films - in 2020 the city became a UNESCO City of Film). The movie trilogy changed Hollywood because Peter Jackson proved a blockbuster series did not have to be made in the US or Europe, almost like bringing a cinema-Olympics home, he made one of the largest film franchises in box office history in his native country. Of course I haven't yet spoken to the quality of the film and the storytelling, but the Return of the King was the one that quietened the critics, sweeping the Oscars and lifting Jackson up alongside names like Spielberg, Lucas and Cameron. The art and craft of the film is apparent throughout, with the film drawing on a vast pool of New Zealand-based talent - costume, cinematography, set design, SFX - and on the weekend of the 2003 premiere the whole country stopped for a movie premiere. Jackson quickly followed up with a long wished for faithful redux of King Kong (with giant Weta bugs included) and The Hobbit turned into a somewhat over-bloated trilogy (the book is about a 1/10th in length to LOTR) but no matter it is this canonical trilogy and this final chapter that forever changed Aotearoa New Zealand and transformed power structures in Hollywood opening up film production and having countries compete for film incentives from Wellington to Warsaw, Vancouver to Vilnius. Jackson and creative partner Fran Walsh retains their waterfront home in Wellington and live on a sprawling campus in the sunny Wairarapa - with a similar manse occupied by James Cameron just next door. When it all started with a quintessentially Kiwi horror films with exploding sheep in the 1980s, who knew it would come to this?"
"Merata: How Mum Decolonised the Screen",4.0,"Merata Mita passed away suddenly in 2010, and the film works she has left behind are Taonga that tell the story of a nation. In Day 507, Merata bore witness to the eviction of Ngati Whatua from their ancestral land on May 25, 1978, and she chose to record this on film with the full support of the people of the land in a film that was riveting, heartbreaking, groundbreaking. She then followed that up with Patu! in in 1981 as she followed a nation rent apart with the Springbok tour, anti-Apartheid protesters batting rugby fans in an nation where the game takes on religious significance. Her only dramatic feature, Mauri, remained the only feature drama made by a Maori woman director until it was remedied by anthology feature Waru in 2017 (8 Maori women directors each making a segment of the film) and then Cousins in 2021 co-directed by Ainsley Gardiner and Briar Grace-Smith. This documentary, made by Merata's son Hepi Mita (whose late father is veteran NZ filmmaker Geoff Murphy) is a sensitive, kind and powerful look at his mother's life and work, with the behind the scenes stories you only get when it is the family of the subject who is telling the story. Merata Mita left us too soon, with much more work to do and projects to progress (she for years worked on the aforementioned Cousins) but her legacy lives on, and both Maori cinema and global Native cinema have risen up because of all she did for us. Moe mai ra, Merata Mita, moe mai ra."
"Barry Barclay: The Camera on the Shore",4.0,"Ngati (1987) was the first feature film with Maori in all lead
creative roles: director Barry Barclay, scriptwriter Tama Poata, Wi
Kuki Kaa in the lead. Ngati was a quintessential East Coast classic that captures a time gone by, both in its 1950s setting (before the East Coast declined and the Maori urban drift) and its 1980s production (so many of the actors and talent have now passed away). Graeme Tuckett's film documents the making of Ngati, and spans the entire career of the late Barry Barclay, a unique visionary who coined the (now commonly agreed upon) term of '4th Cinema' to describe Native cinema, the literal 'camera on the shore' awaiting the colonizers to land. Barry Barclay was also an apprentice to John O'Shea, perhaps NZ's greatest Pakeha filmmaker of the 20th century (certainly the most prolific). Having personally known Barry, this is a tough and emotive watch for me but for film historians it is a must-see. Mauri Ora, Graeme Tuckett, we will always remember Barry Barclay and all he did to change NZ cinema. Moe mai ra, e hoa Barry Barclay, moe mai ra!"
"Whale Rider",4.0,"Back in 2011 for Mana magazine's 100th anniversary issue, I named Whale Rider one of my top five Maori films of all time. Whale Rider made an Oscar-nominated star of Keisha Castle Hughes, Niki Caro's adaptation of Witi Ihimaera's children's book is an uncompromising magical realism feminist fable that sings the song of the sea. I still can feel the tingle on my fingers as young Paikea walks alongside her marae (meeting house) and runs her hand against the wall, her marae having the same grooves as my marae in Nuhaka. When I travel overseas I ask people if they've seen Whale Rider, and invariably they say yes they have. I then let them know that Ruamano, the pet whale of my local tohunga (shaman) Ruawharo, is first cousins to Paikea, the pet whale in Whale Rider. Witi Ihimaera found a non-Native director for the film, and had to buddy up with German financiers (thus the Maori-German baby to the wife of Cliff Curtis at the end!) but this film put Niki Caro on a long path to Hollywood success and is a landmark in NZ cinema."
"Pretty in Pink",4.0,"Four Stars. Ra Whanau Kia Koe, Gemma G!"
"Rain",4.0,"Christine Jeffs stepped away from New Zealand after the success of Rain, with features made in the UK and US. Nevermind, because she left us Rain, the quintessential Kiwi summer bach movie, hinting at Ozploitation films like Don's Party there's something not quite right in the smoky G&T fogged summer haze, the young children enjoy their freedom but perhaps they're a little too unsupervised? A teen girl's blossoming into womanhood to be celebrated but perhaps it makes her prey to…"
"The Price of Milk",4.0,"One half of the Front Lawn performance troupe with fellow musician Don McGlashan, Harry Sinclair soars here in a fantastical & sexy moo-vie set on a dairy farm. In 2000, who knew New Zealand would rise to become the dairying capital of the world? (on the plus side we got the best coffee - flat white anyone? - on the minus all our rivers are f*cked) No matter, this film is a joy from start to finish I only wish he'd…"
"Scarfies",4.0,"Sarkies first feature and he made an impact. Firmly rooted in Dunedin and the dank, cold world of Uni flatting, Scarfies is imbued both with humour (you will see more later on in films like Two Little Boys) and with an eerie hint of horror and Kiwi noir (which hit hardest in Sarkies' best film Out of the Blue). Features Taika Waititi in one of his earliest acting roles, comedic chops apparent from the get-go. I'd watch this again in a minute, its a Kiwi classic - if you slummed it in a NZ Uni town, you will relate to this movie.
This link on Youtube looks dodgy but then so is the movie, kinda:

"Boy",4.0,"It's hard to imagine an Aotearoa New Zealand without the film 'Boy' such was the cultural phenomenon of Taika Waititi's first homegrown hit. Filmed on location in the small, remote East Coast town of Te Kaha (where Taika grew up) and set in the 1980s (soundtrack to the decade fully intact) the film is an honorific to Michael Jackson yet somehow gets away without playing a single MJ song (Kiwi hit 'Poi E' is the crowd pleasing film closer, danced in a 'Thriller' style) such is the genius of Waititi. There's a Youtube video of how Taika Waititi is the master of happy sad cinema, and its on full display in 'Boy' - somehow the darkest of stories of a mother dying in childbirth is there on full display in a NZ film that is a beloved children's classic. In less capable hands, this simply would not have worked, indeed it is as if Waititi is a trickster or master of disguise in his storytelling. Much like Once Were Warriors and Whale Rider made the careers of their Maori cast, James Rolleston went on to more powerful work such as Dark Horse though he's yet to crack Hollywood (unlike wunderkind Taika). Boy is the classic of classics. There's a reason why its the top NZ film of all time. Timeless.

"Knock at the Cabin",2.0,"Oh dear. The apocalypse will not be televised! I've just lived through Cyclone Gabrielle and folks, I'm sad to report the apocalypse will not be televised. Ok maybe this film is a bit dreamy and made up, but it plays on people's fears of what they see on the news (we're CONSTANTLY bombarded) but in a real apocalypse, there would be no power, there would be no cable tv, there would be no Internet, there would be no live crosses…"
"Once Is Not Enough",3.0,"Criterion Channel - oh wow this one was a surprise. David Jannsen put your clothes back on!"
"The Inspection",5.0,"Brutal and visceral, you're locked to the screen from start to finish. Highly recommended, but a tough watch at the same time."
"We Are Still Here",5.0,"It's five stars for me. Guardian gave it 4. Can't argue with that, either.
Look out for my interview with some of the team coming up soon."
"Annette",1.0,"So isn't this movie simply a treatise about the need for child labour laws to stop all the baby abuse? Like the puppet baby is an avatar for millions of third world children trapped in child labour? Anyway, if you look at it this way it suddenly becomes VASTLY more entertaining! (PS that guy from BBT was VASTLY underutilised!)"
