"Pinch",3.5,"Very impressive directing/producing/writing/starring effort from Uttera Singh. Spread its story out a little thin but there's some truly excellent stuff here"
"Alice-Heart",4.0,"Had a wonderful time with this film, felt a lot like Frances Ha but with its own Philly flair. Would love to see Lissa Carandang-Sweeney in more films. Also, don't think I didn't notice that Jim Thorpe Film Festival badge in Tony's car, I still have the same one from seeing Hundreds of Beavers there!"
"It Ends",4.5,"Crazy fucking good. Couldn't believe how strong the acting and chemistry was, couldn't believe what a masterful tonal balance this struck between terror, quiet dread, and laughing in the face of the abyss. Favorite film I've seen at Philly Film Fest (I've only seen 4 so far, I kinda suck at this whole festival thing)"
"The Return of the Living Dead",4.0,"I don't know if this actually happened in real life"
"Jay Kelly",3.5,"It's good, but there's an inescapable 'woe is me' quality that never fully goes away even during Clooney's best scenes. It quickly becomes evident that the emotional core lies with Sandler's character, to the point where I had to question why the story wasn't about him. As a Baumbach fan I'm disappointed that the dialogue wasn't sharper and the message wasn't conveyed in a more subtle manner; it really isn't like him to turn in a script so standard. Credit…"
"Devil Story",1.0,"Fun when the man is randomly trying to shoot the horse. Awful otherwise"
"Hamnet",3.5,"Stunning performance from de-aged Hayden Christensen at the end as Hamlet"
"Wake Up Dead Man",4.0,"After the screening there was a Q&A where Rian Johnson was asked if casting Jeremy Renner was an intentional nod to the hot sauce joke in Glass Onion. Nope, apparently Rian just really wanted to work with Jeremy Renner, then realized he already did the hot sauce gag, and said 'Ah fuck it' and cast him anyway. You KNOW this mf was on the Jeremy Renner app 24/7"

"One Battle After Another",5.0,"Grips you from the first minute and refuses to let go. Whether you're struck with fear by the ever-relevant depictions of militarized violence, or you're laughing at the hundredth dadfailure Leo moment, you're in for an absolutely unforgettable time at the movies. I seriously feel bad for every other film that comes out this year."

I could've watched the first party scene for another 3 hours and I don't even think that's one of the top 5 best scenes in the movie. They treat Mark Wahlberg's dick like it's the contents of the Pulp Fiction briefcase and it's great. I love when Don Cheadle is happy in movies!
Between this and Punch-Drunk Love, PTA might already be my new favorite director. And I haven't even seen There Will Be Blood yet! Fuck, man! Movies rule!"
"Hard Eight",3.5,"Hard Eight? More like Hard Left, did not see some of these plot developments coming"
"The Naked Gun",4.0,"Legacy sequel so good that I'm lowering my score for Happy Gilmore 2 in response"
"The Wedding Singer",3.5,"Once you've seen the other 50 Adam Sandler movies you really start to stomach the expected flaws that are in most of his comedies and get completely drawn in by what a natural and charismatic lead he is. There's a lot of annoying cliches and humor I don't care for here, but I cried at the song he sings at the end so who really cares"

"Funny People",2.5,"The first half of this is an 8/10!"
"Reign Over Me",3.5,"They gotta stop calling it Shadows of the Colossus man I know Don Cheadle's character would reasonably make that mistake but Adam Sandler's character should be obsessed enough to know there's only one Shadow in the title"
"Hotel Transylvania",2.5,"Crazy how unrecognizable Sandler's voice is here. Like even in Uncut Gems he sounds like himself, but here he just goes full Drac dude"
"You’re Bacon Me Crazy",1.0,"Top 1 best movie titles of all time"
"Blended",2.5,"Adam Sandler really said 'What if I made Just Go With It again'"
"Airheads",2.5,"Fun premise but it gets old pretty quickly"
"Uncut Gems",5.0,"If this was set in 2025 the bejeweled Furbys would've been Labubus. Glad we don't live in that timeline"

"The Great Muppet Caper",4.5,"Never has a movie scene been more committed to the bit than the Piggy's Fantasy water ballet sequence"

"50 First Dates",3.5,"So damn sweet you forget that a walrus projectile vomited in the first 10 minutes"
"Punch-Drunk Love",5.0,"Was gonna rewatch this at the end of the Sandler marathon but I kinda couldn't wait. I have not been able to stop thinking about this one. Real life-affirming shit. Uncut Gems has 'bumpable up to 10 on rewatch' potential so there's still a race for Sandler's best movie. But I don't know, I think it's kinda decided already"
"Big Daddy",3.5,"Can't believe this almost made me cry what the hell"

"The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!",4.0,"That guy who played Nordberg is going places"
"Sorry, Baby",3.5,"Really wanted to love this, the performances are great, the direction is good, the story structure is excellent. I guess I just found the dialogue to be a little standard and unengaging a lot of the time, especially in comparison to how gripping the wordless nighttime driving scene was. I think the main character using humor to cope is a smart idea that usually worked, but there are some jokes that landed with a thud (my audience of mostly women…"

"The Waterboy",3.0,"If the sight of Kathy Bates doing a little dance on the sidelines doesn't make you crack a smile, you might be dead inside"
"Happy Gilmore",3.5,"Alright this one's really funny, I'm not made of stone"
"Shark Tale",5.0,"Caught this at the Music Box in Chicago. There was a drag queen dressed as Lola who introduced the film. The entire audience laughed at least 30 times, murmured excitedly when Scorsese's name appeared in the opening credits, and clapped a ton at the end. It wasn't even ironic, either. I think they all genuinely had a great time with the movie, which was weirdly beautiful to see?
Honestly, this movie isn't 'good', but it might genuinely be one of the funniest and most easily rewatchable DreamWorks movies. The voice actors weirdly all kill it and it's so uniquely flawed in a way most other bad kids movies aren't. A true original. I don't like it but I do adore it."
"Smurfs",1.0,"Emblematic of every problem with modern studio filmmaking while also feeling like it should have come out in 2005. It's incredible that executives still think there is enough cinematic potential in the fucking Smurfs to greenlight the third reboot in less than 15 years. Exactly as bad as I was expecting, I just wish it could have been worse since at least then I would have remembered it in a day's time."
"Spanglish",3.0,"I liked the scenes where Adam Sandler was a chef because they reminded me of Jon Favreau's Chef (2014). If you know you know"
"Superman",3.5,"Did Lex just call Superman a groomer"
"Sandy Wexler",2.5,"Weirdly conflicted on this one. For every shockingly sincere and kind of sweet moment there's Rob Schneider in brownface to balance it out"

"Frankenstein",3.0,"This is a fine enough film on its own and an absolutely shocking watch by 1930s standards, but I did not do it any favors by reading the vastly superior original novel beforehand. This lacks both the pathos and the most haunting passages of the novel; nothing here even comes close to the abject horror of 'I will be with you on your wedding night.' I also think the 'degenerate criminal brain' element of the plot is one of the worst adaptational changes I've seen in anything. It was pretty epic when the unloved lab experiment finally made his first friend in a little girl named Maria though"
"The Do-Over",1.0,"The fact that this miserable joyless sack of shit film has a 2.2 average while The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle only has a 2.3 is insulting.

On the flip side, this is best one for Benji and his relationship with Ethan so far by a long shot. Making him the damsel in the third act was a stroke of sheer brilliance. The underwater scene is not only nail biting, it's a great showcase for how thoroughly Benji believes in Ethan even as Ethan expresses visible unease about his capabilities for the first time. Real heartwarming stuff.

His latest performance in 'The War With Grandpa' delivers a different type of evil, not of a mobster or a psychotic loner, but of a grandpa consumed by greed and his lust for power. Mr. De Niro, in an Oscar-winning...uh, Oscar-worthy performance, gives us a reminder of the heart of darkness within our ancestral blood. Congratulations to an acting legend."

"Saturday Night",3.5,"Gabriel LaBelle is so damn electric in this!! So glad he wasn't a one-hit wonder after Fabelmans, he's the glue that holds this together. Little too self-congratulatory at times, little too inauthentic, and I would never feel an ounce of empathy for Chevy Chase no matter how hard a movie makes me try, but after a while I really got into the chaotic theater kid energy this movie radiates.

"Baby Assassins: Nice Days",4.5,"WHERE THE HELL DID THIS ONE COME FROM? Right from the get-go it's easy to tell what a staggering directorial improvement this is over the first two, on top of having an actual consistent story with genuinely high stakes and danger, without sacrificing the quirky charm of our two protagonists. The best of the trilogy by far; the other two are cute and fun, but for a series that's basically 'John Wick meets iCarly', I'm glad we finally got an installment that took more from the former instead of the latter."

"Terminator: Dark Fate",2.5,"Lots of good ideas here, Linda Hamilton's performance is great, this is probably the most interesting (albeit underdeveloped) use for Arnold since T2...and yet the main character kinda fell to the wayside a bit, the villain was pretty forgettable, and the visuals reeked of generic CGI gray sludge.

"Trap",3.5,"Lmao this was so fun, Josh Hartnett gives one of my favorite performances of the whole year. Laughed out loud at so many ridiculous things in the first half and I think that was actually intentional!
The second half lost me a bit once you're forced to take the story and characters seriously (Hartnett has a lengthy scene with another character that would have been soooo good if we actually got to know her in the first half), but overall a great time at the movies!

"Terminator Salvation",2.5,"Christian Bale randomly does his Batman voice on occasion and CGI Arnold shows up with no dick and balls. I definitely liked it less than the previous film, but the story was kind of interesting on paper and the third act was kinda cool. Definitely sauceless overall but I have yet to see a truly irredeemably awful Terminator film. Oh well, there's always next time."

"The Tale of The Princess Kaguya",5.0,"With you, Sutemaru, I might have been happy.
Absurd that Isao Takahata's name does not carry the same level of reverence and awe from the general populace as Hayao Miyazaki's. I suppose it comes down to his masterpieces being fewer in number and far less marketable. Regardless, this is the ethereal, untouchable magnum opus of an artist at the pinnacle of his career. The best animated film I have ever seen in my entire life, and quite frankly, it isn't close."

"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines",3.0,"Surprisingly watchable? It's derivative as hell, the attempts at more iconic Arnold one-liners are cringy, the villain feels less threatening than the previous one, the CGI is noticeably worse than the installment that released 12 years prior, the ending is kind of annoying...but I kinda had fun regardless? Whatever, I'm sure it only gets worse from here."
"DAN DA DAN: First Encounter",4.0,"Great show that I can't recommend to anyone because of the first episode 👍"
"The Penguin",4.0,"One of the rare upsides of the streaming era is that thanks to a corporate desire for an extra Batman-adjacent box to click on Max, we can get exciting, engaging, excellent television that enriches and enhances its cinematic universe. Gonna be thinking about THAT scene in the finale for a while."
"Conclave",2.5,"Well acted, decently well shot, staggeringly unengaging. I see the vision of other users on this site highlighting how juicy and petty the infighting is in this movie, and I fully think it should have leaned into a more lighthearted tone. The election of a new pope feels inconsequential in this despite the movie's consistent, suffocating attempts to paint it as The Most Important Event In The History Of Mankind. Nowhere is this more evident than with the unbearable score; it's hard to imagine its composer having ever watched the movie he was working on. It's this exact tonal disconnect, this attempt to feel weighty and significant, that makes the film ultimately reek of disposability. I liked it better than Berger's previous film."

Spielberg obviously wasn't a good fit for this story but the man knew how to frame an interesting shot. Great performances here at least!"

"Megalopolis",3.0,"Was dazzled and bewildered in equal measure by this. I'm not one of those squares who needs a coherent plot or a sensible magic system in order to get into a film like this; I was absolutely captivated by multiple sequences, in fact. However, I couldn't help but feel a bit let down by the lack of meaningful character progression in this. It feels like Cesar never changes over the entire film's runtime no matter what he goes through, and this is a major contributing factor to the film's conclusion feeling so hollow and unearned. I know, I know, this isn't the kind of film I should try and apply storytelling logic to, but I feel like I would have enjoyed it more on the whole if it leaned into the abstract entirely and didn't even bother with a narrative. Ultimately however, it's not about what I want, and I'm glad we got to see an old man's completely uncompromised and kooky vision unfold on the big screen. Every possible opinion on this film is indeed correct; there's enough brilliance and utter dogshit to swing the pendulum in either direction. Aubrey Plaza MVP, I legit didn't know she had that performance in her."

I'm undoubtedly a sucker for emotional cores, which this movie provides in spades, while also being arguably Ripley's most compelling outing as a protagonist. (Despite my disdain for it, Alien 3 is a contender for that honor, though I think the equal measure of Ripley grappling with PTSD and stepping into a surrogate mother role for Newt puts her role in this movie over the top.) There's certainly more to be said, and perhaps I will express it all in the future. For now, let me just ponder why that mf Burke wore flannel to check out the potentially hostile alien planet"

As a certified Prometheus (2012) enjoyer, I felt as if this one was too cowardly to follow through on its predecessor's general tone and ideas in a lot of ways. The sole vast improvement this one offers over the previous film is David; an already great character who in this film becomes far and away the greatest non-Xenomorph antagonist to ever grace the series.

Undeniably pretentious and heavy-handed with many illogical moments to be found, but weirdly beautiful and captivating at the same time. As grand from a directorial standpoint as you would hope, with enough heart pounding sequences and existential dread to overcome my initial skepticism of how much I could really get out of a mostly Xenomorph-less Alien movie. For being one of the most divisive blockbusters of the 2010s, I definitely wasn't expecting to come out of this one on the side of its fans. I think it's pretty good! Who knew?

It really helps that Alien 3 single-handedly destroyed my investment in anything post-Aliens that happens in this universe. So sure, why not?

Boring sidekicks, buffoonish villains who teleport to wherever the plot needs them to be, a complete lack of visual style, trite dialogue outside of a single good one-liner about Poland, and an overwhelming sense of 'been there, done that' permeate this obscenely dull and overly long snoozefest. For all the anticipation that this could possibly have been the 'Logan' of the Indiana Jones series, it's a film entirely uninterested in examing him as a character for the majority of its runtime, instead being content to let us gawk at an 80-year old man going on one last trek through a Legends of the Hidden Temple set. How in the ever-loving fuck did this cost $300 million to make???
A couple decent action scenes, some very scarce emotional moments here and there, and when Antonio Banderas showed up for 5 minutes it was nice to hear the sweet sultry tones of Puss in Boots and remember what it felt like to watch a good movie.

The first half of this is pretty much perfect, from the madcap editing and storytelling to the magnificently realized musical numbers. The second half took a bit of a tumble into bland melodrama (and the duke is kind of a supreme dumbass for not realizing the play was about him sooner) but overall it's a movie that I CANNOT believe I liked as much as I did.

"Yona of the Dawn",3.5,"It ended just as it was getting really good :/"
"The Batman",4.0,"Holy shit that score FUCKS. Michael Giacchino here are the keys to my house go fuck my wife
Yeah this movie is great! Robert Pattinson might be my favorite Batman to date, and his story actually has a ton of great shit to say about the very nature of the character. There's a line said towards the end that chilled me to the bone specifically because of who said it, and a scene shortly after which, while probably not intended to be a tear-jerker, actually got me a little weepy. It's just the exact sort of deconstruction and evolution this character needed, y'know?
Visually this feels the closest a movie has gotten to representing the look and feel of the Arkham games, which was a delight to see. It's a movie so confident in its story and world that it even throws in welcome dashes of the kind of comic-book silliness someone like Nolan would never dare to touch. And that's perfect! Batman stories deserve to be both serious and silly, and this is the first one I've seen that truly nails the tone of this character.
I prefer Dark Knight as a movie, but I think this is a better BATMAN movie, if that makes sense. A couple messy plot points and pacing issues hold it back a bit, but I could forsee a rewatch potentially bumping my score up to a 9. It'll be a real tough act to follow, but I truly can't wait to see what Matt Reeves has in store next."

Definitely feels like the second part will be the more interesting story (idk tho I've never touched the book), and with a foundation this strong, I'm going to be in sheer agony waiting for the sequel.

"Little Shop of Horrors",4.0,"I've always championed this as the one movie adaptation of a musical that actually improved upon the original stage version, but after rewatching it for the first time in forever, I'm not so sure that's true. I think I was just taken in by the best puppet effects ever put to film and the insanely incredible 'Mean Green Mother from Outer Space' song to notice how many songs that contribute crucial story and character beats were cut. It's not like the original musical is particularly long; I see no reason to cut as much as they did outside of maybe budgetary restrictions.
Cut songs is par for the course for any movie adaptation of a musical; what really stings, though, is the theatrical ending. Without spoiling anything, it just...doesn't gel with the messages the story is trying to portray. Seek out the original ending if you're planning to watch this; it's amazing to see the musical's ending fully realized on the big screen, and it works a hell of a lot better than the sappy conclusion we actually got.
I've been complaining a lot in this review but the score is still high because Little Shop is simply THAT good of a musical, and this is still one of the best stage-to-film adaptations out there. I'd probably give it a 9/10 if I had never seen the original musical and didn't know which parts were missing. And if you've never seen the original musical, this movie is an amazing way to get into it. Please don't remake it, Hollywood. Leave it alone."

"Shiva Baby",3.5,"Loved the sheer fucking chaos of this movie, I only wish it would have built up to something more climactic by the end. But overall, super fun time"
"Chaos Walking",1.5,"There sure was a lot of chaos and walking"
"Whiplash",5.0,"Yep, still the best movie I've ever seen.
#TerenceFletcherIsOverParty"
"Whiplash",4.0,"Surprised I never checked this out before, it's a neat little watch! It's cool to see this prototype version of a scene from the film that surprisingly has most of the same dialogue intact. It also made me appreciate the lighting, editing, and especially Miles Teller's performance in the film even more cause this kid...ain't that great"
"The Father",4.0,"Man, fuck Paul"
"The Trial of the Chicago 7",4.0,"I was expecting to be bored out of my mind but this was honestly really engaging from start to near-finish. Top notch editing and the direction isn't nearly as bad as everyone on here is saying. Rylance steals the show amidst the excellent stacked cast. I think a couple of Sorkin's lines are too Sorkin-y for their own good, and it ends on an extremely bizarre and out-of-nowhere note, but overall, a highly enjoyable film."
"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie",4.5,"Had to rewatch this in honor of March 14, THE DAY THAT KRABS FRIES"
"My Neighbor Totoro",4.0,"Not to imply unoriginality, but the cat bus does remind me of Morgana from Persona 5 🤔 🤔 🤔"
"Minari",4.5,"Intimate and gorgeous. I was a bit iffy on the score, but otherwise, one of the best slice-of-life films I've seen in ages. I hope it gets all the Oscars, but even if it doesn't, it got my heart. And that's all that matters."

"Star Wars: The Clone Wars",2.0,"If you have any attachment to Ahsoka's character whatsoever, don't rewatch this movie."
"Ace Attorney",3.0,"While extremely faithful to the original game in terms of its tone, look, and storyline, I feel like the most of the game's character work was lost in translation. The condensed time spent with these characters means the loss of some great character arcs for Phoenix, Maya, Edgeworth, and Gumshoe. I feel like I barely know who these people are, since the plot is always the focal point of the film and there's little time to breathe.
Coming fresh off the game, I followed the plot well enough but I feel like there are so many details that just aren't explained particularly well, plus a lot of drawn-out sequences. The direction and cinematography were solid but could have veered a little further into the bizarre. Ultimately, it was cool to see the characters in live-action, but I feel like Ace Attorney would be better suited for a miniseries than a regular film. Still, an above-average attempt."

"Atlantis: The Lost Empire",4.5,"I can't believe how amazing this movie is.

"The Iron Giant",3.5,"From a purely directorial standpoint, this has all the hallmarks of Brad Bird's signature genius. It's also pretty solid emotionally with some excellent animation to boot. I really wish I could join the rest of y'all in saying it's a 10/10 masterpiece, but much like HTTYD2, I just have a ton of story and character problems that piled up over time.
The villain is a horrendously embarrassing and annoying dipshit, the mother is sidelined incredibly hard, the beatnik guy is incredibly hard to pin down a motivation for, the fact that Hogarth starts playing with the robot immediately before the army has even left the town just reeks of contrived conflict and idiocy, I could go on.
But it's still a good movie and I still like it for all the same reasons everyone else likes it despite my problems with it k thx bye"
"The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)",4.5,"I think Noah Baumbach has become my favorite screenwriter; his movies capture the complexity and messiness of relationships so effortlessly, be they friendships, marriages, or in this case, parental bonds (or lack thereof). There's a whole lot of truth in this script and these performances, and the film choked me up on more than one occasion.
The first half of the film is basically flawless but the second half loses the snappy, nonstop compelling dialogue in favor of slower, less interesting shenanigans and a really awkwardly edited fight scene. Couldn't really decide when to end either, but overall, another excellent entry in Baumbach's amazing repertoire."

Not quite as hysterical as the first, but it makes up for that by being actually kinda solid emotionally?

"Once",3.0,"I'm definitely missing something here cause this didn't work very well for me at all. It leaves a terrible first impression with the cinematography at the beginning, but that aspect improves as the film goes along (even if the flat lighting doesn't). The bigger issue for me is how the script feels entirely barebones, rendering the story and romance very basic and unengaging. I don't feel a particularly strong connection between the main characters and I don't feel like I know them well at all.
The movie's saving grace is definitely the music; every song sequence is genuinely magical and it elevates the entire package. I wish I could just fall in love with this film; it's impressive for a low-budget picture and I'll probably be listening to the songs again. I'll probably give the Broadway musical a try; hopefully without the budget-related issues this film is unfortunately afflicted with, and hopefully with a better script, I'll get into it a lot more."
"Being John Malkovich",3.5,"Honestly fuck Maxine, Lotte deserves so much better"
"I’m Thinking of Ending Things",5.0,"Every single line of dialogue in this movie is entirely deliberate, a piece of an exceedingly intricate puzzle that you slowly start to piece together over the course of the film's runtime. Shockingly, at no point does it become tedious, repetitive, or boring. It's a genuine thrill to see how even the most mundane conversation can be warped into something far more important and meaningful over time.
I can't even begin to process how deeply this movie affected me. I…"
"Mulan",0.5,"Fucking worthless. It strips the original film of nearly everything that made it special, but forgets to add anything worthwhile as a substitute. It is inferior to the original in literally every respect. If that's not enough, it also contains the most fucking abysmal editing I've ever seen in a major motion picture. I'm baffled that Disney considered this theater-worthy for the longest time, and doubly insulted that they have the gall to charge $30 for such an irredeemably awful pile of garbage. A new low for the Disney live-action remakes.
But at least it's better than Artemis Fowl."

I know there's still technically two movies left in the marathon, but in my heart, this is the DreamWorks series finale. It's been a somewhat rocky road, but films like this one made it all worth it."

"Heathers",3.0,"Stilted and awkward in a lot of ways; while it does tell a compelling story and offer a handful of great quotes, it does it with such little energy and poor pacing that it's really hard to get invested.
I should mention that I'm a massive fan of Heathers the Musical, which takes the elements of this film that work and really goes all out in crafting an outrageous, tense, compelling comedy-thriller. This film is more of a novelty as a result; it's not something I'll ever really go back to, but if it's any consolation, the story and characters live rent-free in my brain cause of the musical.

"Exit Through the Gift Shop",4.0,"Watched this in film class and my God this is BONKERS. Easily the most insane documentary I've ever seen. Is it real? Was it staged? Who cares?
Thierry Guetta cements himself as the Tommy Wiseau of the art world, and his story is as hilarious as it is thought-provoking. I'm gonna be pondering the nature of art criticism and subjectivity for weeks to come after seeing this. Great stuff."

"Persepolis",3.5,"Pretty good adaptation of an exceptional graphic novel. It just suffers from an incredibly rushed pace since they're trying to cram a lot of plot into a 90 minute runtime, which deflates a lot of the dramatic weight from certain story arcs. It's still a good, powerful film, but I strongly recommend reading the book first, if possible."

The weakest one, but still pretty good :)"
"Kung Fu Panda 2",4.0,"Great sequel that isn't afraid to tell an even more emotionally rich story than its predecessor. It's much slower paced and not nearly as funny, but it shines in its second half and leads to a sensational climax. Ending really made me soft <3"

"Little Women",4.5,"Look all I know is if Timothee Chalamet asked me to marry him I would not fucking hesitate"
"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World",4.5,"This is the best one. A truly moving story about a world unable to adapt to change despite the best efforts of those who try to champion peace. Entire sequences are carried by the score, much like the first film. The character dynamics are incredibly strong, the animation is flat-out insane, the villain is a significant improvement over the last movie, and this is the first one of these movies to make me cry. An absolutely perfect ending to what is easily the best animated trilogy of all time."
"How to Train Your Dragon 2",3.5,"Didn't really get into this one as much, I thought the middle was significantly slow and didn't progress as masterfully as the first. Third act felt rushed in comparison. Wasn't a fan of many choices the characters made. The humor from the side characters was passable in the original but obnoxious here. And the score was a massive step down.
But hey, the main characters were still great and the emotional beats hit extremely hard, maybe even harder than the…"
"How to Train Your Dragon",4.5,"Wtf why this movie so damn good? It's perfectly paced, incredibly powerful, striking from an animation perspective (save for a poorly rendered character here and there). Why did I never like this as a kid? It's the best DreamWorks movie of 2010, the year that also gave us Megamind and Shrek 4. HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT OUTPUT OF QUALITY IN THE SAME YEAR. SHARK TALE HAS NO EXCUSE ANYMORE"
"Cats",1.0,"This is literally just a typical production of Cats, y'all are overreacting like hell. 'Weirdest movie ever?' Come on. I'm a theatre kid. I've had weirder shit for breakfast.
That said, Cats is such a shitty musical that a painfully average production of it is still REALLY bad"
"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker",2.5,"Starts out pretty fun but gets infinitely worse the longer it goes on. There are no characters in this movie; just action figures that are whisked from planet to planet in an excessively manic story that feels like it was written by an 8-year-old. Palpatine sucks ASS in this movie. Everyone other than Rey and Kylo pretty much sucks. It rings hollow, far more than any Star Wars movie that came before it.
And yes, The Last Jedi was better.…"

"The Farewell",3.0,"Gonna have to sort this into the 'I don't get the hype' category of films sadly. It's a really great concept for a story, but it feels thoroughly underdeveloped. I wanted to learn more about who Billi is as a person, get more scenes exploring the cultural differences between America and China, and really see the main conflict and the ethics surrounding it get explored and fleshed out to a greater degree. But the movie just kinda felt repetitive after a while, never quite reaching the dramatic or comedic heights the story really deserved. Sorry, Nai Nai."

I really wish I could join everyone else on the hype train with this movie, but I found much of it overstuffed and messy. The direction and cinematography didn't really stand out. The de-aging effects are a little jarring for the first 30 minutes or so, tho they fortunately blend into the background after a while. And I never really got the decision to solely…"

I'm not sure if some of the dialogue was quite as tight as I wanted, plus the score is a little overbearing at times (Randy Newman, man. Sigh.), but the actors easily pick up all the slack. Career-best turns from Driver and ScarJo.

The New Hope rehashing surprisingly works for me, because the script and direction evoke a very different tone to that of the original Star Wars even though they follow the same plot beats. Sometimes the movie bends a little too far backwards to justify a New Hope parallel (Starkiller Base is the lamest shit ever) but for the most part, I'm really…"

The Ewoks are hilarious and I don't have much to complain about with them. Jabba slays me with all of his wacky line deliveries. Overall, the humor in this film works surprisingly well, to…"

My dad, eager to properly introduce me to one of his favorite franchises, asked, 'Do you want to see…"
"Knives Out",4.5,"Rian Johnson subverted my expectations except it was good this time
Absolutely brilliant deconstruction of the murder mystery genre. Hardly anything played out in the way I expected, and I was glued to my seat the whole time. The excellent script, tight direction, and wonderful performances all come together to make such a pretty picture. I would've liked more development for some of the characters, but ultimately, I realize that they aren't the focus of the story. Which is great; the structure of this film was wildly subversive and unlike any other mystery I've seen. So satisfying.
And holy shit, Ana de Armas is a fucking star now! I'm so happy, I watched her on this Spanish thriller TV show called El Internado a couple years back. I was so excited to see her play a significant role in Blade Runner 2049, and now I'm beyond thrilled to see her as the lead of a feature film. It's so cool to discover someone early on in their career and watch them achieve huge success; the more movies with her, the better!"
"Star Wars",4.5,"Delicious. Finally, some good fucking food.
Watching this movie with fresh eyes, without thinking about the baggage associated with the franchise nowadays, is an absolutely magical experience. The worldbuilding and unfolding mysteries are astounding. The character interactions are my favorite parts; for instance, seeing Han and Obi-Wan play off of each other is great, since their vastly different perspectives make for excellent exchanges. Everyone has great chemistry, the setting is well-defined, the campiness honestly enhances the viewing experience. Only thing…"

To be fair tho, Krennic and K-2SO are amazing. The last 10 minutes are sufficiently powerful and dramatic. The action is stellar. Fits very snugly into the canon and compliments A New Hope nicely. I understand why this…"
"Frozen II",3.0,"Simultaneously feels bigger and smaller than the first film. I was really invested in the first hour and the mystery it was building up, but then the story kinda fizzled out into nothingness. Really wastes the vast majority of its characters, both old and new. Stakes feel relatively low due to the vagueness of the story. Songs ranged from pretty good to pretty forgettable; nothing awful tho.
I can't decide which one I like better; nothing in this movie angered…"
"Frances Ha",4.5,"Love it. A beautiful portrait of a woman trying to find purpose in spite of numerous personal and career setbacks. The use of music to highlight those fleeting moments of happiness and fulfillment in Frances' life was inspired. Black-and-white cinematography didn't seem necessary but it's hard to complain when the film is visually stunning regardless. Gerwig and Baumbach make their voices equally heard throughout the script, and the result is sensational.

"Parasite",4.5,"Let's get one thing straight: Parasite is phenomenal. It's a stunning, subtle, and immensely powerful piece on class warfare and the nature of the human condition. It's also a tense, funny, extremely entertaining film that didn't feel its length at all. Go into it without knowing anything if you can; it made my viewing experience all the more exciting.
But with that said...I didn't really like the ending? Tons of details, character arcs, and storylines felt like they were dropped in an instant. And yeah, I know that was the point. But I'd be lying if I said the lack of resolution given to certain characters is something I'm happy about. Like, for how well set up and intriguing Ki-jeong's sociopathic tendencies are, THAT'S what you do with her?
I don't expect my disappointment with the ending to subside with time, but don't let that dissuade you from seeing this film. It's still excellent and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. It's pretty much everything Jordan Peele's 'Us' should have been."
"The Lighthouse",5.0,"The closest thing we'll get to a modern-day 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Robert Eggers has given us an absolutely mesmerizing piece of art that begs to be interpreted in a number of ways. I couldn't tell what the hell it meant while I was watching it, and from the sound of things, neither could the other 20-somethings I left the theater with. This is not a film that will appeal to everyone; not in the slightest.
And yet, even though I had very little idea what was happening, I was still mesmerized. The cinematography and intentionally tight aspect ratio made for an effortlessly uncomfortable experience. The sound design, holy shit! It was immensely haunting and I don't expect to forget it anytime soon. The set was great as well; honestly, I'd love to see this adapted for the stage, the script is a great showcase for wonderful directing and acting.
AND THE ACTING! DEAR NEPTUNE, I FORGOT WILLEM DAFOE WAS A HUMAN BEING. He gives the performance of a lifetime and gets absolutely lost in the role. His monologues are equal parts astounding and terrifying. THE LIGHTING ON HIS FACE DURING THAT ONE SCENE GODDAMN.
Robert Pattinson had me worried cause it felt like he couldn't commit to an accent for a little bit at the beginning, but once he gets going, there's no stopping him. Another career-best performance, though he is outshined pretty hard by Willem Dafoe.
It's a terrifying, bizarre, uncomfortable, shocking experience that a ton of people are gonna hate.
And it reminded me why I love movies in the first place."

I'm not super into Ryan Gosling's performance but the gorgeous cinematography, breathtaking musical numbers, electric romantic chemistry, and sublime writing perfectly illustrate why Damien Chazelle is an absolute master of his craft. Not quite as perfect as Whiplash, but it does have the slightly better ending. Hell, maybe the best ending I've ever seen in a movie."
"The World’s End",4.5,"A bit weak comedically, but it's still an incredible, subversive, witty, amazing film. The dramatic stuff here is the best in the trilogy, the stakes are easily the highest, the characters are fun and entertaining. It's a fantastic finish to one of the greatest trilogies ever made, even if it falls ever so slightly short of Hot Fuzz."
"Hot Fuzz",4.5,"A bit of a slow burn at times and those twat side cops are really irritating. But the payoff is beyond phenomenal; this is a fantastic, hilarious murder mystery turned action masterwork, where every line of dialogue can and will come back later in some shape or form. An step up from Shaun of the Dead in terms of tight direction and an even tighter screenplay."
"Shaun of the Dead",4.0,"Surprisingly works better for me from a dramatic standpoint than a comedic one.

"Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood",3.5,"Damn Robin from Stranger Things made a really good life choice in this movie
Tonally alien from most of Tarantino's other works, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood plays out more like a loosely connected series of vignettes rather than a flowing narrative. Unfortunately, unlike something like Pulp Fiction, where every segment intersects in some way while the film remains entertaining throughout, this movie feels much less focused and has largely underdeveloped themes and character motivations.
Sharon Tate has nothing to do the entire movie, Cliff is difficult to sympathize with for a number of reasons, and Rick Dalton, despite having a compelling storyline, still feels largely unfocused on for a good chunk of the movie. I'd call this one of the best Leo performances, but one of the best Leo roles? Not so much, even though the pieces were there and Tarantino decided not to put them all together.
With that said, the movie is suspenseful, well acted, decently shot, and mostly entertaining throughout despite being way too long. I feel like the ending is a make-or-break aspect of the film for most people, and for me? It made it. Not only was my mouth gaping wide during THAT scene, but I think the resolution to Rick's storyline is a really clever commentary on how we perceive heroism and how much violent shit we excuse in media because we simply chalk it up to 'heroism'. It was a well set up conclusion on multiple levels.
Overall, a worthwhile film, even if it feels like Tarantino dropped the ball in various areas. It's no Pulp Fiction or Inglorious Bastards but I'd still recommend checking it out. Even if it is WAY too long."
"Tarzan",3.0,"Not a bad movie, but it personally kinda disgusts me. It throws the musical format out the window for horribly implemented samey Phil Collins music that doesn't hold a candle to any other Disney Renaissance soundtrack. Turk is also the most annoying creature on the planet. But there are some good emotional beats and great action to make this still a worthwhile film to watch. It's just not one I revisit, like, ever."
"Mulan",3.5,"Pretty good. I think it's a really well-told story, but the comedy doesn't always land for me and the villain, while really menacing, is so disconnected from the hero that it's hard to get invested in them. As a musical, this one is kinda weird; there are less songs than usual, which I guess is owed to the more serious, war-like tone. But still, it kinda feels like there's something missing from this one compared to the other Renaissance films.
Also they didn't have to go that hard with I'll Make a Man Out of You but they did and it slaps"
"Hercules",4.5,"I...like this more than Hunchback. I can't believe it either. It's just such a witty, energetic screwball comedy with an amazingly expressive animation style and a story structure that takes full advantage of the fact that it's a musical. Every song is a banger as well. I guess it's tonally inconsistent at times, but really, who cares when the characters are incredible and the story, while basic, is really heartfelt and compelling? I could go on but I'll save it for the video. Bottom line is, this movie slaps."
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame",4.5,"Changed my mind about this one. It deserves a 9/10 despite being an utter tonal disaster. Not just the gargoyles; the slapstick during the fight scenes is straight up embarrassing. But WOW this movie is otherwise astounding. Unbelievable songs, an unforgettable score, great characters, and the best Disney villain ever (even though I complained about him, he's still amazing for Disney) makes for one of Disney's grandest, most ambitious works.
The stage musical is still better tho"

This is a really solid, enjoyable film. I'm not overly attached to the characters or story of this one, but fantastic songs, one hell of a final battle, and that goddamn amazing Robin Williams performance make this a treat to revisit."
"Beauty and the Beast",5.0,"God, what a work of art. Ever since I was a kid, I had a feeling that this movie was a cut above the rest of Disney's works, and boy was that feeling correct. The romance is perfect, the songs are gorgeous, the characters are endearing, and as a bonus, we get the meme dispenser that is Gaston. I love this movie with all my heart and I don't think I'll ever stop loving it."
"The Little Mermaid",4.5,"Got a new big video ranking coming! This time, I'll take a look at all the Disney Renaissance films.
THIS ONE IS SO GOOD. Perfect pacing, stunning cinematography, breathtaking animation, vibrant colors, phenomenal songs, great characters. Ursula is such a bad bitch, Sebastian is hilarious, Ariel is really compelling. Seriously I don't remember this movie being this fantastic when did that happen???"
"Phantom Thread",4.0,"The first half-hour is pretty slow but after that this movie becomes an absolutely engrossing tale of a couple desperately trying to manipulate each other and gain the upper hand in their relationship. I didn't see many of these plot points coming and I was always on the edge of my seat. It's also surprisingly funny and a great, if unconventional, final role for Daniel Day-Lewis."

"Toy Story 4",3.5,"Good movie that never really justifies its existence. The supporting characters are great but they don't have a ton of funny jokes unfortunately. The stakes feel relatively low and a lot of the plotlines could have used more development. I liked it enough but it just barely rises above Finding Dory and Incredibles 2.
Oh, and it's better than the first movie at least. This is a solid 7 while that one is a shaky 7 teetering on 6"
"Toy Story 2",5.0,"Great comedy, strong dramatic touches, a really engaging central conflict, a ton of character depth...this is the bestest one"
"Toy Story",3.5,"It's not really amazing until the last 20 minutes, but man are those last 20 minutes amazing. Woody is an annoying asshole most of the movie, Sid's house is such an unpleasant location, and the animation has aged way worse than I remember. But ultimately the Woody-Buzz dynamic carries this movie pretty far. Still, 2 and 3 outshine it pretty hard."
"Bumblebee",3.0,"Gets worse the longer it goes on but it's mostly really charming and cute. John Cena's line about the Decepticons' name made me belly laugh cause that's exactly what I was thinking"
"The Emperor’s New Groove",4.0,"It's honestly kind of miraculous this movie works as well as it does. I feel like the lack of songs is really felt in this one (especially since Snuff Out the Light is a great villain song that was unfairly cut) but the fantastic comedy bits and amazing character development for Kuzco make this such a blast to rewatch over and over"
"Hoodwinked!",3.5,"Low-key iconic"
"Arrival",3.5,"A really intriguing and well-crafted sci-fi mystery. Denis Villeneuve is such a master of his craft that it's truly astounding, and I love how this movie takes its time to establish how difficult it would be to communicate with an alien race. Amy Adams is excellent as always as well. But not every scene felt necessary to me and it kinda dragged on at some parts. Still, one of the better sci-fi films in recent years"
"Rocketman",3.0,"While BoRap was one straight line of quality, this film is one of soaring highs and dull lows. Anytime it goes into a musical sequence, it's enthralling with amazing filmmaking and performances. Anytime it isn't, it's...kind of dull? There's some good drama towards the end but for the most part I was just kinda waiting for the next musical number the whole time.
Still better than BoRap"
"Booksmart",4.5,"It just got funnier the second time lmao"
"Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace",2.0,"More fun than I remember. The environments and characters either look really good or hysterically bad. Jar Jar and Anakin are annoying but in an amusing sort of way. Watto, Nute Gunray, and Boss Nass are all comedy goldmines. It really is just one of those so bad, it's good movies; all of its blunders are either hilarious or endearing, and I had a great time rewatching it."
"Booksmart",4.0,"Plays like a mix of Lady Bird and The Nice Guys, which is a surprisingly good combo. So utterly fun and enjoyable with some hilarious characters, great direction, and amazing editing. Some characters could've been set up better and the ending kinda confused me but suffice to say I can't wait to see this again"
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse",5.0,"I can't think of another movie that genuinely gets better and better on repeat viewings to this extent. Wow."
"Coco",4.0,"Kinda flawed in the story department in a lot of ways but I honestly don't care. This is a beautiful love letter to Mexican culture and a great musical to boot. The characters are super endearing and the complex interwoven backstory holds up so well on repeat viewings. It also has the best ending of any Pixar film, period."
"Zootopia",3.5,"The Shakira song is laughably terrible but I like this movie a lot otherwise. Great dynamic between the two main characters and some interesting, mature themes for a kids movie. I wish the story was a little more engaging but still very intriguing and fun"
"Inside Out",4.0,"Creativity overload, in a good way. The story isn't great and the plot holes are pretty problematic but this movie's so engaging and fun that it doesn't matter. There are so many funny, expressive, heartfelt moments and characters that make this film an absolute Joy to revisit. It's not one of Pixar's absolute best, but it's pretty close."
"Big Hero 6",2.5,"THAT WAS HIS MISTAKE
If it wasn't for Baymax this movie would legitimately bore me out of my mind. It's really lame as a superhero movie and a Disney movie, and I hate T.J. Miller in this sooooooo much. But y'know it's not awful or anything. Just...10 years behind the curve. Actually, scratch that, Pixar made The Incredibles 10 years before this came out so it's more like 15 or 20 years behind."
"Frozen",3.0,"Yeah yeah yeah it's fine, has some good songs and characters but also some bad songs and characters. It's inferior to Tangled and Moana in nearly every way but at least Olaf is funny"
"Aladdin",2.5,"Half the time it's surprisingly good, well-acted and compelling. The other half it's hilariously incompetent to the point of providing tons of ironic enjoyment.

This is also…"
"Toy Story 3",4.5,"The inverse of Up, where the ending is what's always praised to no end and the rest of the film is kinda forgotten about. The good news is that unlike Up, this is a rich, thoroughly enjoyable story throughout the entire film. I'm a sucker for elaborate prison escapes and this film delivers, complete with a fantastic villain and great jokes. It's not quite as good as 2 but it's still a worthy successor that builds on 2's themes in a beautiful way"
"Shark Tale",5.0,"Why haven't I reviewed this yet? Best movie of all time for sure. Like, I deadass have no idea what score I would legitimately give this movie because I derive so much ironic enjoyment from it.
It's ok, a lot of white fish can't review movies."
"John Wick: Chapter 2",4.0,"A significant improvement from the first, the action is more enticing and the story is more engaging. The two halves of this movie are kinda two different movies, and while the first half is solid enough, the second half is exhilarating and satisfying. I love how well set up the rules of this universe are, to the point where I actually said 'Oh no' out loud during a certain scene. You know the one."
"John Wick",3.0,""
"Up",3.5,"Cute kiddie fluff with an excellent opening and score. Take those out and ehhhhh. Don't get me wrong, Dug is really funny and it's a nice little adventure but it's not really thematically cohesive like Wall-E or Shrek 2. If people could stop calling this the greatest Pixar movie based off of the opening alone that'd be great."
"WALL·E",4.5,"Stunning. Way better for me as an adult than it was as a kid. The fact that Wall-E barely talks and yet manages to be one of the most well-realized and charming characters in animated history speaks volumes. The environmental message is well handled, the romance is believable. The weak villain is really the only thing holding this back from a perfect score."
"Ratatouille",5.0,"The polar opposite of Happy Feet: a rich, intelligent, funny, thought-provoking masterpiece. This is the most underrated Pixar film by far and one of my Top 3 Pixar favorites. It genuinely feels like a smart indie film made for adults, which again, is a testament to Brad Bird's ingenious writing. I will never get tired of revisiting this movie."
"Happy Feet",1.5,"Astonishingly bad. There is no story structure, the characters are either flat or annoying, random plot points and themes are piled on top of each other with no rhyme or reason, the character designs are unappealing. I thought Brave was the worst Best Animated Feature winner for sure, but leave it to this movie to prove me incredibly wrong. I can't even believe this is a real movie."
"Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit",4.0,"Effortlessly charming with great characters and expressive animation. Horror parodies usually make me roll my eyes out of my skull but this one does it with such finesse and absurdity that I genuinely adore it."
"The Incredibles",5.0,"An absolutely flawless, mature family drama. It genuinely feels like it was written for adults first and kids were kind of an afterthought. Animation as a medium rarely gets better than this."
"Finding Nemo",3.5,"A lot funnier than I remember. Stunning animation, very emotional and entertaining. I'm not a huge fan of Dory or the Tank Gang and some scenes aren't as good as others. But a really good entry in the Pixar canon, even if it's not a favorite"
"Spirited Away",5.0,"It's Spirited Away what the hell else do you need to know"
"Shrek",3.5,"I'm in the process of going through every Best Animated Feature winner for an upcoming video. Might as well review them yo
So Shrek is really good. The cast is pitch-perfect and their line deliveries add so much to their characters. Very mature love story with great humor, though a little dull at some points. Pales in comparison to Shrek 2 but still a great movie in its own right"
"Pokémon Detective Pikachu",3.5,"This. Movie. Is. BONKERS. Suffice to say I will have a full review out in a couple days but in summary I really really really liked it"
"The Shape of Water",3.0,"Such a strong year for movies, such a forgettable Best Picture winner. The direction and score are fantastic; Del Toro and Desplat definitely earned those Oscars, but the story is largely uninteresting and the slow pace doesn't help matters. Michael Shannon's character is kind of a joke and not really intimidating, and even though I love weird stuff in movies I draw the line at fish sex. Oh, and that scene in the movie theatre? Painfully pandering. You're better than that, Guillermo."
"First Man",2.5,"Damien Chazelle is my favorite director, and his direction is the best part about this movie. But maaaaaaaan, this script does not match the brilliance of his presentation. It's exceptionally dull and I don't buy Ryan Gosling in this role, I'm sorry. Great performance from Claire Foy and some excellent sequences here and there but the screenplay really sinks this one for me."
"Bee Movie",2.5,"Such a bizarre movie conceptually, but it's kinda boring in its execution. The plot is haphazard but it's not Shark Tale levels of hilariously incompetent so there's not a ton of ironic enjoyment to be had. Patrick Warburton is the best part but that goes without saying"
"Edge of Tomorrow",4.5,"A phenomenal, underrated action movie. Time loops are my jam (I'm the biggest Majora's Mask fan on the planet, after all) so this movie's fun premise, coupled with great performances and solid direction makes for such an incredible moviegoing experience. More people need to see this."
"Avengers: Endgame",3.5,"Good-ass movie about a rat that saved the universe"
"Avengers: Infinity War",4.5,"Better log this before I see Endgame tomorrow.
As of right now, the best MCU movie. A monumental achievement that I rewatch scenes from on at least a weekly basis. I could never sufficiently put into words how much I adore this movie."
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2",4.5,"I ugly sobbed. I love this movie so fucking much. It's a top 3 MCU movie for me and I could watch it a million times without getting tired of it. I will be making a video about why this is a perfect sequel, don't you worry."
"Incredibles 2",3.0,"Ah yes, the original 'painfully average' movie. Upon further thought, it's way better than the other films I've given that moniker to. It's fun, has great writing and inventive action, and the score is solid. Filler nonsense and a weak plot/villain/finale really drag it down, and it has little to no emotional weight. But it's still enjoyable; if we only had to wait 2 years for this instead of 14 then I think I'd feel a lot better about it overall."
"Spider-Man: Homecoming",3.5,"Better than I remember. Funny, cute, exciting. It's cool to see how normal people live within this universe and I like the small stakes story that still manages to give the hero a chance to prove himself. The car scene is top tier MCU."
"Captain America: Civil War",4.0,"The smartest Marvel movie, but also kind of the dumbest. If Cap had just communicated better with Tony then 80% of the movie's conflict would've been solved. Also Zemo's plan is bonkers. But yeah pretty fantastic in spite of the narrative flaws"
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade",4.5,"This movie is Raiders, but better in like, every way. It's exciting, it's super funny, you buy the emotional connection between Indy and his dad, the villains are great, the action is superb, Marcus Brody is such an endlessly entertaining buffoon. Just watch this movie if you enjoy fun. It's the best Indiana Jones movie and one of the best Spielberg movies."
"Ant-Man",2.5,"It's cute for an hour but then I got really bored and I wanted to turn it off. Rewatches have usually slightly improved the Marvel origin movies for me, but it did the opposite here"
"A Quiet Place",3.0,"John Krasinski is clearly a very talented horror director, but unfortunately his deft touch is burdened with a really stupid script that puts its characters in unnecessary danger for the sake of getting more scares. Worth a watch, but I don't expect to check it out again."
"The Nightmare Before Christmas",3.5,"I'm not sure why they hired a different voice actor for Jack's speaking voice when he has like 5 spoken lines
Anyway yeah good movie, visually stunning if a bit slight on story. Songs are aight"
"Iron Man 3",4.0,"The best Iron Man movie. Y'all just hate fun."
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame",4.0,"I can never make up my mind about this one. It's a gigantic tonal mess with awful slapstick and comic relief, but this one ultimately has some of the best dramatic moments and songs in the entire Disney pantheon. The stage adaptation is better but kudos to Disney for really giving it their all with this one and creating a cult classic that's starting to gain more recognition as time goes on"
"The Big Sick",4.5,"An exceptionally enjoyable rom-com with solid performances from everyone involved. You can tell this was a passion project for Kumail and his wife, it comes across so strongly in this funny, heartfelt film. Ray Romano's voice is like butter in any movie he's in so there's that too"
"The Grand Budapest Hotel",5.0,"An utter delight of a film that I continue to revisit on a regular basis. It might actually be Wes Anderson's best movie, which is saying quite a lot."
"The Good Dinosaur",1.5,"...at least it's pretty."
"Boyhood",1.5,"A miserable experience that thinks it's way more profound than it actually is. It has nothing to say and its only value as a film comes from the novelty of its gimmick. Watch Lady Bird or The Florida Project instead."
"Iron Man 2",2.0,"This movie is actually pretty solid for a first hour, but after Tony Stark pees in his suit the movie enters a downward spiral that it never recovers from. Still, if this is the weakest MCU movie, we could be doing a lot worse."
"Shrek the Third",1.0,"There is actually no reason to watch this"
"Shrek 2",4.5,"Legitimately one of the best sequels ever made, building upon everything that made the original movie special, while adding its own signature flavor to the franchise. Prepare to feel an unexpected feel."
