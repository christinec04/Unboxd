Ocean’s Eleven,4.0,"A couple days ago I was grabbing dinner at this nice new ramen place. There I was, content with my noodles, oblivious to the world around me. Before my food arrived, I caught a few glimpses of a movie playing on the large flat-screen across from my table. Images of George Clooney and a fresh-faced Matt Damon flooded my eyeballs, and I vaguely recognized the film based on years of cultural osmosis. One of those Steven Soderbergh Ocean movies, I think? I've heard decent things about them; maybe I should check them out in a more appropriate setting than this. I'm here for ramen and nothing else.
As I enjoyed my meal, thoughts of the movie left my mind entirely. I definitely didn't catch any of the rather low audio emanating from the fairly distant TV, and my eyes were firmly averted and focused on my ramen. Yet, as it was a rather slow day for business, a couple of the server girls found themselves gathering around the TV, and i couldn't help but overhear them trying to place the name of the film itself, as well as an actor they recognized.
'Yeah, what's his name again?'
'Oh, I think that's Don Cheadle.'
My head jolted up in an instant. It couldn't be.
But lo and behold, there he was, looking younger and more spry than I had seen him in quite some time. It was the man of the hour, every hour to be precise.
Don Cheadle was in the Ocean trilogy.
How could I have never known? I hold celebratory events on Twitter in honor of his birthday every year! I quote his iconic catchphrase from the 2015 megahit Avengers Age of Ultron, 'Boom, you looking for this?' on a regular basis! I sat through that fuckass Space Jam movie to see him!
If I had known he was in a popular and acclaimed trilogy of heist movies, I would have dropped everything and watched them many years ago. How did I waste so much of my life not knowing this crucial cinematic fact?!?

Lake Michigan Monster,4.0,"A fascinating rewatch in a post Hundreds of Beavers world. Compared to that movie's universally appealing sense of humor, this one is so ultra specific and so niche that I can see why it only majorly took off among my circle of friends. A couple stretches are a bit dryer than I remember (looking at you, cruise ship bit) and while there are so many comedic swings that still hit home runs for me, there are a surprising number of ones that fall a bit short. I was always enamored with the low-budget wit and ingenuity of this one, but now that I've seen those same elements on a much grander scale from the same team, it's hard to justify keeping this one at the same score. But it's still great! Captain Seafield still remains one of the funniest cinematic protagonists I've ever seen, this movie inarguably has the better song compared to its successor, and don't even get me started on the damn ghost army",True,0.042,0.795,0.163,0.9684

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,1.5,"A near-inconceivable trainwreck. I went in morbidly curious if it was slightly better or worse than Crystal Skull, and instead I got something whose closest kin is Rise of Skywalker, undoing nearly everything from its controversial predecessor but forgetting to fill the gaping hole at its center with anything meaningful or worthwhile.
Boring sidekicks, buffoonish villains who teleport to wherever the plot needs them to be, a complete lack of visual style, trite dialogue outside of a single good one-liner about Poland, and an overwhelming sense of 'been there, done that' permeate this obscenely dull and overly long snoozefest. For all the anticipation that this could possibly have been the 'Logan' of the Indiana Jones series, it's a film entirely uninterested in examing him as a character for the majority of its runtime, instead being content to let us gawk at an 80-year old man going on one last trek through a Legends of the Hidden Temple set. How in the ever-loving fuck did this cost $300 million to make???
A couple decent action scenes, some very scarce emotional moments here and there, and when Antonio Banderas showed up for 5 minutes it was nice to hear the sweet sultry tones of Puss in Boots and remember what it felt like to watch a good movie. I guess it's also nice to get confirmation that a megacorporation like Disney could never recapture the magic of Spielberg, no matter how good the cover artist they hire is in theory.",True,0.091,0.763,0.146,0.9436

I'm not sure if some of the dialogue was quite as tight as I wanted, plus the score is a little overbearing at times (Randy Newman, man. Sigh.), but the actors easily pick up all the slack. Career-best turns from Driver and ScarJo.
Interestingly enough, a ton of people have said they found it hard to pick a side in the divorce, but I though Nicole's side was significantly stronger the whole time, and Charlie needed to be knocked down a few pegs. That's kinda what the movie felt like it was about; giving Charlie some much-needed growth as a person while Nicole gets to be the person she always wanted to be. I really cared for him by the end, and I cared for her from that first monologue with the lawyer. Great stuff.

Alien: Covenant,2.5,"And the award for most predictable movie twist goes to...
As a certified Prometheus (2012) enjoyer, I felt as if this one was too cowardly to follow through on its predecessor's general tone and ideas in a lot of ways. The sole vast improvement this one offers over the previous film is David; an already great character who in this film becomes far and away the greatest non-Xenomorph antagonist to ever grace the series. Fassbender brings such fantastical and disturbing glee to the role, which makes the progression of David's maniacal God complex truly awe inspiring.
Everything else in this movie isn't.
Far and away the least interesting and most infuriatingly incompetent group of protagonists the series has ever seen. What a truly incredible feat to not even consider wearing helmets on this uncharted alien world you just found out about weeks ago. Let's all split up in this android's bizarre castle of death, why not? Oh hey, something's clearly suspicious about him! I guess I'll follow him, ALONE, to this weird egg dungeon of his. Oh, he really wants me to stick my face up against one of these things? Don't mind if I do dawg. What could possibly go wrong.
The main lady, whose name I could not possibly remember if you put a facehugger to my head, is unbearably bland when put up against the badassery of Ripley, the devotion of Shaw, or even the simple yet effective emotional core Rain brings to the table through her relationship with Andy. What's the emotional core here? She's sad that her husband James Franco died? That's great and all but we don't know him! I'm sorry I couldn't be bothered to connect with her standard, played out grief. And why was it James fucking Franco?
I don't think it's a controversial statement to say that David is far more terrifying than the Xenomorphs in this film, but that's not solely a compliment directed at him; it's really hard to overstate just how unterrified I remained from the moment I saw that first little cartoonish CGI one unconvincingly scurry across the screen. (Not a CGI hater when it's used effectively or convincingly, it just wasn't here in the slightest!) The spine birth scene was pretty gnarly, but unfortunately the movie never strived to match that level of horror again. I mean, I wasn't supposed to laugh out loud at the shower scene, was I?
The main thing that really drags this film down for me is just how incongruent the Xenomorph stuff feels next to the genuinely compelling sight of David playing God. Even with the obvious narrative connection, the titular aliens feel like an afterthought, something that we mainly need to awkwardly squeeze into the last 20 minutes in order to appease those who felt slighted by how different Prometheus was. As someone who genuinely enjoyed Prometheus, I oddly find myself having trouble picturing someone who likes both of these films in equal measure. I wouldn't call this a betrayal of what Prometheus accomplished and what it was building towards, but it certainly doesn't feel like a natural continuation. There's the obvious factors, like the sharp deviation this film makes from the implications of Prometheus's ending, but there's also a general toning down of the lofty, somewhat pretentious, hyper-religious themes found in that movie. They can still be found in Covenant here and there, but let's just say it's easy to tell that this was from a completely different writing team. Unfortunately, I find myself siding with the ambitious, grandiose, often too big for its britches script, rather than one so bland and unspecial that I can't recall a single line of dialogue that didn't come out of David's mouth a mere half hour after watching it.

The Empire Strikes Back,5.0,"At the age of 7, I knew practically nothing about Star Wars. It was the Burger King kid's meal toy promotion for Revenge of the Sith that got me fascinated in all these weird aliens and robots. I got the Han Solo toy that came with a carbonite shell to put him into, and had so much fun playing with it. My dad, eager to properly introduce me to one of his favorite franchises, asked, 'Do you want to see the movie where Han gets frozen in carbonite?'
So there I was, watching my first ever Star Wars film, getting absolutely transfixed by the epic battle of Hoth, the funny robots, the cool lightsaber fights, and the sad ending made a little brighter by that pretty sun they were all staring into by the end. Immediately after it was over, I asked to see the other 5 movies. I was hooked forever.
Unbelievably, Empire Strikes Back manages to invoke the same feelings of transfixion and awe every single time I rewatch it. While it maintains the simple, pulpy, campy fun of the original to a degree, it fleshes out its cast and their relationships by putting them through constant, unrelenting hardship. The emotional toll this story takes on every one of its characters is what sets it apart as a tremendous installment of both the original trilogy, and the saga as a whole.
Much like how Revenge of the Sith belongs to Palpatine, this movie belongs to Darth Vader. His decently evil presence in the original film is cranked to the max, and his endless torment of both the rebels and his own officers that fail him makes for such a vicious, calculating antagonist. This is the movie that made him one of the greatest villains in cinematic history, and that twist completely changes the trajectory of the entire saga, while also being shocking in its own right.
Everything involving Yoda is truly magical; there's so much weight behind every one of his lines and actions once he reveals his initial ruse. Yoda paints a picture of the magnificence of the Force, and the power the great mystery holds. Every one of his scenes holds tremendous purpose, not only in teaching us more about the Force, but about Luke as well. One of the most clever touches is during his encounter with Vader in the cave. You hear the lightsaber sound, but you don't see if Luke or Vader is the one who turned it on. Then, Luke backs up, and you see that his lightsaber is the one that ignited. He failed Yoda's test by using the Force for attack rather than defense, and he does the same thing when confronted with the real Darth Vader at Cloud City. Brilliant.
My favorite scene in the film, hell, the entire Star Wars saga, is Han being frozen in carbonite. The tragedy of the moment is illustrated perfectly through Han and Leia's farewell kiss, and there's someone so mystifying about 'I love you.' 'I know.' It gives me chills every time and I can't explain why; it's simply perfect from a character perspective. And the shot of the smoke from the carbonite chamber clearing away to reveal Vader's sinister visage, as the Imperial March plays...cinema doesn't get better than this. It really doesn't.
Empire Strikes Back is THE perfect sequel, the film that changed everything for the Star Wars saga and opened it up to truly magnificent, emotionally resonant storytelling. It's hard to imagine what would've happened to the franchise had this follow-up installment not soared in the way it did, but fortunately for all of us, it did. This movie will always hold a special place in my heart for introducing me to a galaxy far, far away, but its sheer dramatic weight has firmly planted it as one of my favorite films ever made.

Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,3.5,"Damn Robin from Stranger Things made a really good life choice in this movie
Tonally alien from most of Tarantino's other works, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood plays out more like a loosely connected series of vignettes rather than a flowing narrative. Unfortunately, unlike something like Pulp Fiction, where every segment intersects in some way while the film remains entertaining throughout, this movie feels much less focused and has largely underdeveloped themes and character motivations.
Sharon Tate has nothing to do the entire movie, Cliff is difficult to sympathize with for a number of reasons, and Rick Dalton, despite having a compelling storyline, still feels largely unfocused on for a good chunk of the movie. I'd call this one of the best Leo performances, but one of the best Leo roles? Not so much, even though the pieces were there and Tarantino decided not to put them all together.
With that said, the movie is suspenseful, well acted, decently shot, and mostly entertaining throughout despite being way too long. I feel like the ending is a make-or-break aspect of the film for most people, and for me? It made it. Not only was my mouth gaping wide during THAT scene, but I think the resolution to Rick's storyline is a really clever commentary on how we perceive heroism and how much violent shit we excuse in media because we simply chalk it up to 'heroism'. It was a well set up conclusion on multiple levels.
Overall, a worthwhile film, even if it feels like Tarantino dropped the ball in various areas. It's no Pulp Fiction or Inglorious Bastards but I'd still recommend checking it out. Even if it is WAY too long.",True,0.079,0.742,0.179,0.9848

They advance the theme very well and that's fine, but is this really a shining paragon of musical storytelling if the leading man doesn't utter a single note?

Everyone has great chemistry, the setting is well-defined, the campiness honestly enhances the viewing experience.

And the score was a massive step down.

This obviously was never gonna work as a straight-up Beauty and the Beast remake, which is why I was so pleased to see this movie evoke that story's premise and imagery, only to go in a completely new and thrilling direction with it. There's definitely some clunkiness to be found in the narrative, with a lot of dots that don't seem to clearly connect at first glance, but ultimately the emotional impact conveyed through the animation, music, and well-intentioned story are too strong to deny.

Every one of his prior films is absolutely excellent in their own wright, and I couldn't wait to see what he could do with a straight-up horror film for a change.

...what the fuck happened?

I just found this so tasteless and vile, like, are cheap jumpscares the best way to explore this particular kind of trauma? There are so many better and more subtle ways this story could have (and HAS) been told, and it feels like this movie has nothing to add to the conversation despite insisting that it does. Its horror and social commentary both come across as trite individually, but when mixed together they just feel alarmingly heinous.

The direction and editing here are shockingly lifeless; it feels like anyone could've made this. I don't think the genre shift is a valid excuse either; Baby Driver is an action movie that still distinctly feels like Wright's handiwork. This feels genuinely amateur in places, both on its own and especially in comparison to Wright's otherwise spotless filmography.

The cast is all great in spite of how trite and stock their characters are. The early scenes in the 60's are shot with clear passion and care. And I think that's where my praises end? Overall, a stunning misfire in nearly every way and one of the biggest disappointments in recent memory.

As grand from a directorial standpoint as you would hope, with enough heart pounding sequences and existential dread to overcome my initial skepticism of how much I could really get out of a mostly Xenomorph-less Alien movie.

Paprika,3.0,"Hmm...I definitely vibed with the animation, sound design, direction, editing, all that good stuff. But to me, this lacked the emotional investment needed for one of these kinds of intentionally confusing and disorienting films to work. Perfect Blue managed to be more overwhelming to the senses AND more emotionally impactful by perfectly getting you into its protagonist's fractured headspace. This, by comparison, felt stretched in far too many directions for me to really connect with anything going on. I also don't really get the Inception comparisons - yes, people invade other people's dreams, but that's sort of where the plot similiarities end. Inception may lack an emotional core to some extent, but it has the benefit of an enthralling clear-cut heist plot with clear-cut stakes. This film, however, just felt vague, cold, stoic, and emotionally distant whenever it cut away from the imaginative dream sequences.

Yeah this movie is great! Robert Pattinson might be my favorite Batman to date, and his story actually has a ton of great shit to say about the very nature of the character. There's a line said towards the end that chilled me to the bone specifically because of who said it, and a scene shortly after which, while probably not intended to be a tear-jerker, actually got me a little weepy. It's just the exact sort of deconstruction and evolution this character needed, y'know?
Visually this feels the closest a movie has gotten to representing the look and feel of the Arkham games, which was a delight to see. It's a movie so confident in its story and world that it even throws in welcome dashes of the kind of comic-book silliness someone like Nolan would never dare to touch. And that's perfect! Batman stories deserve to be both serious and silly, and this is the first one I've seen that truly nails the tone of this character.
I prefer Dark Knight as a movie, but I think this is a better BATMAN movie, if that makes sense. A couple messy plot points and pacing issues hold it back a bit, but I could forsee a rewatch potentially bumping my score up to a 9.

Villain uses Julia to get to Ethan like in 3, threat of nuclear fallout like in 4, the same villainous group and the return of the main villain from 5. Hell, even the helicopters are an (albeit far expanded) echo of 1's climax. Yes, the action still rules, but I found this story to be a bit less engaging than the last 3. Cavill is a great addition though, and this one's got some of the best deception scenes in the series (rad that Wolf Blitzer was down for that). And yes, the rumors are true, this one actually made me cry a bit at the end (a series first).

Click,,"I came into this world in a hospital that no longer stands.
The unfortunate truth about our awesome and terrible existence as a species is that the institutions we create will not last forever. Doors will be shuttered, and as the generations march on, so too will our life's work be lost to the cold, unfeeling annals of History.
However, this sentiment need not apply to art.
Indeed, our creations meant to challenge and entertain audiences may endure long after we and everything we have ever stood for crumble into dust. Artistic expression is among the most beautiful and everlasting Concepts humanity has been graced with, and to that end, it would not be unwise to express the sentiment that some works of art, in the vast Cosmos of our existence since the dawn of time, have shone brighter than others.
I stand before you today to inform you of a truly momentous and incomparable milestone. I have at long last achieved 1,000 logs on the website Letterboxd. Long have the masses expressed their surprise that I have not born witness to more feature films at this point in time, but this is merely a reflection of my desire to experience art in all of its forms. Painting, literature, theater, sculpture, and games of the video variety; there is simply so much to experience across different mediums that I cannot relegate all of my limited time on this Earth to merely partaking in Cinema. My horizons are simply too broad for me to achieve the number of logs more befitting of my status as a frequently followed user on this website.
And yet, despite the relatively limited amount of time I am able to devote to cinema, I adore it and rank it among my favorite forms of artistic expression. I stand in utter awe of the meticulous craft and personal stamp that goes into even the dullest of feature films. Of course, this sensation is amplified one hundredfold for the greatest accomplishments the medium has to offer.
With that said... One such film has remained my most anticipated for quite some time. I did not consider myself yet worthy to witness its sheer Glory; however I believe my cinematic profile has advanced far enough to the point where basking in its presence is a worthwhile reward for the amount of time I devoted to the act of experiencing cinema.
Returning to that now defunct hospital, in the dreary afternoon hours of January 9th, 1998, having just been brought into the world and beholding my mother and father's faces for the first time, I immediately spoke aloud the words that would define my life goal for the following 26 years.
'When I reach 1,000 logs on the website Letterboxd, I would like the movie I watch for this momentous Milestone to be the Academy Award nominated film Click (2006) starring Adam Sandler.'
There has been a seemingly infinite amount of academic discussion surrounding Frank Coraci's experimental science fiction Faustian masterpiece, and as such, I feel as if I have nothing to contribute to such rigorous and intelligent discussions held by far greater minds than mine. However, simply leaving you with the preparations I endured for the most significant viewing experience of my life, without delving into the act of the screening itself, would be hearsay to the vision and efforts of Coraci and Sandler. I simply would never be able to live with myself had I ended the review there.
The Academy Award nominated feature film “Click” is a story about rediscovering the euphoric value of life. Sandler’s character Michael Newman, his name a brilliant dual reference to the Biblical Archangel Michael, and the classic Sitcomian character “Newman” from the masterful intertextual experience that is Jerry Seinfeld’s Seinfeld, finds himself suffering from the mundanity of existence and desires a change. The brilliance of this narrative arrives in the form of Christopher Walken’s character Morty, his name a brilliant reference to the eternal classic series Richard and Mortimer.
By offering Michael the inciting remote, which allows him to alter various aspects of his life in unexpected and often quite humorous ways, Morty is essentially putting the onus of godlike power into the hands of a mere mortal, much like how Satan tempted Eve with the Apple of Knowledge in the earliest known text in human history, the Quran.
However, in a divine act of cosmic mercilessness, the remote begins to go haywire, teaching Michael about the inherent value of his wonderful life in the process. The remote is the source of all the good, the bad, and the ugly in Michael’s world. On the one hand, he is the Godfather of his own destiny. But on the other hand, his life collapses around him in an instant, as if he triggered an apocalypse now. Michael initially is so overjoyed by the prospects offered by the remote that it would not be unexpected to find him singing in the rain. And yet, the inherent darkness tied to such a device enables most of Michael’s life to be gone with the wind. Citizen Kane.
The sheer brilliance of Academy Award nominated film “Click” is how deftly and decisively it balances the comedic and dramatic tones inherent to it. Comedy is, of course, a farce; laughter for the sake of laughter is a waste of time and has no place in artistic discussion. However, the use of crass comedy, such as [insert crass scene from the movie here after I watch it] is merely a facade, a veil meant to masquerade the sheer dramatic heft hidden in the later stages of the film. For Click is a litmus test meant to dispel the nonbelievers, the doubters of Frank Coraci’s singular and divinely inspired vision. If you have the gall to doubt the sheer brilliance of this magnum opus of the cinematic medium, then far be it from me to try and steer you back towards the right path. Bluntly put, it’s ok if you give this a bad review. You’re just stupid, is all.
The Academy Award nominated film Click was everything I long yearned for it to be and more. What a momentous achievement in the art of storytelling, performance, cinematography, editing, directing, costume design, production design, original score, original song, documentary feature, animated feature, etc. (The makeup was the only somewhat unexceptional portion of the film.) By the grace of the Lord my God, the brilliant and incomparable Frank Coraci, I stand before you a changed man, a humbled and divinely inspired one. I can never achieve something that captures the raw dramatic potency of “Click”, and yet, if I devote the remainder of my time on planet Earth to capturing a mere 0.001 percent of the film’s majesty and exceptional artistry, then perhaps I can definitively say that my contributions to society at large will be worth remembering…at least for a little while.
I am no fool. After I am long gone, my creative endeavors may persist for perhaps a generation or two, at the absolute maximum. My contributions to this planet will crumble into dust, the foundations buckling under the demented weight of time immemorial. And yours will too. Over the course of constructing my analysis, a startling revelation began to take form within my mind. History is selective in terms of the artistic pursuits it chooses to preserve. We must collectively come to terms with the irrelevance of both our lives and the creations we produce and distribute for the consumption of the populace. Not every piece of art will endure forever.
Yet, Academy Award nominated film Click (2006) starring Adam Sandler will.

The Ewoks are hilarious and I don't have much to complain about with them. Jabba slays me with all of his wacky line deliveries. Overall, the humor in this film works surprisingly well, to the point where it might be the funniest Star Wars film.
For a pretty flatly-written character at the time, Ian McDiarmid absolutely kills it as Palpatine. He manages to embody the ultimate evil in the galaxy while also bringing a fair share of humor to the table. There is something so hilariously petty about him smugly telling Luke 'I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯' He's one of the great cinematic villains, and while the prequels did most of the heavy lifting to get him there, this movie is still a pretty vital piece of the puzzle.

The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),4.5,"I think Noah Baumbach has become my favorite screenwriter; his movies capture the complexity and messiness of relationships so effortlessly, be they friendships, marriages, or in this case, parental bonds (or lack thereof). There's a whole lot of truth in this script and these performances, and the film choked me up on more than one occasion.
The first half of the film is basically flawless but the second half loses the snappy, nonstop compelling dialogue in favor of slower, less interesting shenanigans and a really awkwardly edited fight scene. Couldn't really decide when to end either, but overall, another excellent entry in Baumbach's amazing repertoire.",True,0.105,0.691,0.204,0.919

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,3.0,"I think what ultimately prevents the magnificent Andor from elevating the installment it leads into, whereas something like Clone Wars did wonders for heightening the tragedy of Revenge of the Sith, is the fact that this film simply does not hinge on Cassian as a character the way Sith hinges on Anakin. Sure, I got more emotional at Cassian's fate in this film knowing the full context of his life, but before you get to that (and the admittedly still great final battle), you have to deal with bizarre pacing, an overstuffed roster of characters, some truly groan-worthy cameos, and the unmistakable stench of reshoots that don't paint this as the most cohesive film in the world. To top that all off, this simply isn't Cassian's story anymore. He still plays a crucial role, but this makes for a jarring and disjointed pseudo-finale to Andor, which I wouldn't mind so much if the actual Andor finale wasn't so insistent that you watch this movie to get the full picture. I know why they did that, it makes sense. But it doesn't stop me from wishing this film was a whole lot better.

Once,3.0,"I'm definitely missing something here cause this didn't work very well for me at all. It leaves a terrible first impression with the cinematography at the beginning, but that aspect improves as the film goes along (even if the flat lighting doesn't). The bigger issue for me is how the script feels entirely barebones, rendering the story and romance very basic and unengaging. I don't feel a particularly strong connection between the main characters and I don't feel like I know them well at all.
The movie's saving grace is definitely the music; every song sequence is genuinely magical and it elevates the entire package. I wish I could just fall in love with this film; it's impressive for a low-budget picture and I'll probably be listening to the songs again. I'll probably give the Broadway musical a try; hopefully without the budget-related issues this film is unfortunately afflicted with, and hopefully with a better script, I'll get into it a lot more.",True,0.068,0.685,0.247,0.9914

Little Shop of Horrors,4.0,"I've always championed this as the one movie adaptation of a musical that actually improved upon the original stage version, but after rewatching it for the first time in forever, I'm not so sure that's true. I think I was just taken in by the best puppet effects ever put to film and the insanely incredible 'Mean Green Mother from Outer Space' song to notice how many songs that contribute crucial story and character beats were cut. It's not like the original musical is particularly long; I see no reason to cut as much as they did outside of maybe budgetary restrictions.
Cut songs is par for the course for any movie adaptation of a musical; what really stings, though, is the theatrical ending. Without spoiling anything, it just...doesn't gel with the messages the story is trying to portray. Seek out the original ending if you're planning to watch this; it's amazing to see the musical's ending fully realized on the big screen, and it works a hell of a lot better than the sappy conclusion we actually got.
I've been complaining a lot in this review but the score is still high because Little Shop is simply THAT good of a musical, and this is still one of the best stage-to-film adaptations out there. I'd probably give it a 9/10 if I had never seen the original musical and didn't know which parts were missing.

The action set pieces were also great, you know, whenever they weren't blurry as shit with a bunch of shaky cam. The writing was pretty good, except when it wasn't! Luther asking Ethan if he's ever slept with his sister is the exact moment I remembered what Kurtzman and Orci are capable of. Lindsey's message suddenly being viewable at the most plot-convenient time without any explanation as to why was clever foreshadowing for R2-D2 randomly waking up to provide the final piece of Luke's map. Again, it's like poetry, sort of, they rhyme.
Odd that the movie randomly decides to come out against neoconservatism in the last 20 minutes. Like, cool, but it would've been cooler if this was the theme of the entire movie instead of just being thrown in as a lazy surface level Bush-era critique, you know?

Jim Henson Idea Man,3.5,"Over the past 2 months I've had the pleasure of reading the excellent Jim Henson biography by Brian Jay Jones, which does an absolutely tremendous job of painting a portrait of who this guy is both creatively and personally. I wasn't expecting this documentary to include nearly the same level of detail, but I was nonetheless rather disappointed at how little I got a sense of Jim as a person from this. After a while it mostly becomes an engaging enough doc about his most well-known projects (though The Storyteller and Jim Henson Hour really get shafted - would have liked a lot more elaboration on those!) Ultimately this was pretty solid but I would genuinely recommend the Defunctland miniseries if you want a better fleshed out account of Jim and his career.
To be candid for a moment, I think a large reason I've become so engrossed in learning more about Henson's life is because I relate so heavily to his philosophies regarding work and creative endeavors. To be clear, what I do on YouTube is not even in the same stratosphere as what Henson does, and if you think we're even remotely comparable, you're an idiot. But I've found such fulfillment leading my merry band of editors on creative projects similar to how Jim led his band of puppeteers, and it's only now, after reading about Jim's philosophy on always wanting to keep busy at some new creative endeavor, have I come to terms with my own obsession with never stopping working. Jim had the right idea; if work is fun, fulfilling, and not something you dread or are being exploited by, then it really is the best thing in the world to be doing. I've done at least a tiny bit of work on something every day now for well over a year, and knowing that work all goes towards something at least a couple people out there will enjoy makes every second worth it. I really can't muster that much excitement over the fact that I will soon have 2 million subscribers on YouTube, because the truth is, I would still be making my dumbass videos even if I only had two subscribers.

To be fair tho, Krennic and K-2SO are amazing. The last 10 minutes are sufficiently powerful and dramatic. The action is stellar. Fits very snugly into the canon and compliments A New Hope nicely.

I think the main character using humor to cope is a smart idea that usually worked, but there are some jokes that landed with a thud (my audience of mostly women was dead silent at the 'We...are women' scene). Don't think I heard a single chuckle during the beating a mouse to death scene either.
Ultimately though, it is admirable in a way how refreshingly messy and honest this movie is.

Absolutely brilliant deconstruction of the murder mystery genre. Hardly anything played out in the way I expected, and I was glued to my seat the whole time.

I would've liked more development for some of the characters, but ultimately, I realize that they aren't the focus of the story.

The Do-Over,1.0,"The fact that this miserable joyless sack of shit film has a 2.2 average while The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle only has a 2.3 is insulting. In what fucking universe are they even remotely comparable. You're telling me a swarm of plebians could swarm in at any moment and give the latter film enough negative reviews to bring it down to the level of one of the biggest slogs I've ever seen in my life? What do you people even want anymore. Yeah, I know the CGI looks a bit rough by modern standards. Sure, they probably should have gone with traditional 2D designs for Rocky and Bullwinkle. BUT SO WHAT. The comedy is on point. Joke after joke consistently lands. Robert De Niro poured his heart and soul into getting this movie made, and this is how you treat it? Deeply sickening behavior. Just for that, I'm going to include the Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle in my Adam Sandler ranking despite it not having Adam Sandler in it. I really need to drill into your heads how much better it is than the vast majority of Sandler's filmography that I've had to suffer through already. FUCKING HELL. And that's the thing too, I'm saying this in June. The Sandler ranking isn't dropping until December. You're going to forget about this review over the course of the next 6 months, and then when you finally click on that video, you might find yourself dumbfounded that the Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is included. Hell, imagine being someone who didn't even read this review. What the hell are they gonna think? It doesn't matter dude, this isn't a bit, this is a genuine reflection of my soul. The Adventures of Rocky of Bullwinkle is one of the most unfairly maligned films of the century thus far (assuming the year 2000 is actually a part of this century. Actually my girlfriend and I had a conversation about that just a couple hours ago, funnily enough. She mentioned that the 21st century actually began in 2001, and we got on that subject because we were talking about what my personal game of the century is because of a meme on the Ace Attorney circlejerk subreddit jokingly describing Dual Destinies as the game of the century. As a result, I had to come to terms of the fact that my favorite game of all time, The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, is not actually a game that released in this century. The onus then fell to my second favorite game of all time to be the game of the century, and that would probably have to be Persona 5, but I can't just say Persona 5 is the game of the century, like you understand how embarrassing that sounds, right? I might as well say danganronpa's the game of the century at that point ((I have not actually played Danganronpa)). Anyway if I had to give a more presentable answer then I don't know, Super Mario Galaxy I guess. I don't know if I'm going to get excommunicated from the Persona fandom for this or if they're going to respect me for publicly shunning 5.) Anyway, the adventure of Rocky and Bullwinkle is a true cinematic achievement on par with the Sistine Chapel. I don't think it's going to top the Sandler ranking because, I mean like, come on, punch drunk love and uncut gems are really good.

The first 2 hours are ok.
I really wish I could join everyone else on the hype train with this movie, but I found much of it overstuffed and messy. The direction and cinematography didn't really stand out. The de-aging effects are a little jarring for the first 30 minutes or so, tho they fortunately blend into the background after a while. And I never really got the decision to solely focus on Peggy (if you can call that focus) and not the other three daughters; it would've given one of the scenes in the ending much more impact.
And yet, from the award scene onward, once I saw where Puff Daddy was going with the story, I was totally transfixed. It hit me pretty hard emotionally, and the lack of a musical score really sold the impact. Al Pacino gives the breakout performance of the film, Joe Pesci is also really great, and Don Lino was, again, fine for the first two hours before those last 90 minutes really drove his performance into overdrive.
I feel like condensing this movie into two hours and 30 minutes would make it the masterpiece it so clearly could be. But I'm glad I'm in the minority on this one, and people think it's a masterpiece regardless of its tremendous length. It's really profound to see Puff Daddy making this movie at this point in his career, and I'm glad I got to experience it.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens,4.0,"This movie RULES! It remains just as exciting, impactful, funny, and magical as it was 4 years ago. The New Hope rehashing surprisingly works for me, because the script and direction evoke a very different tone to that of the original Star Wars even though they follow the same plot beats. Sometimes the movie bends a little too far backwards to justify a New Hope parallel (Starkiller Base is the lamest shit ever) but for the most part, I'm really on board with this one.
These characters are instantly lovable and relatable. Rey, Kylo, Finn, BB-8, etc. are all delights, and this movie gives me everything I could've wanted out of an older Han Solo before wrapping up his story in an emotionally resonant way. Also, I'm glad that, aside from Phasma, this movie doesn't treat the First Order as a joke. More on that later...
Filmmaking wise, this is leaps and bounds ahead of most big blockbusters. Great cinematography, striking editing, wonderful practical sets. J.J. proves time and again that he's an excellent sci-fi director.

I'm not one of those squares who needs a coherent plot or a sensible magic system in order to get into a film like this; I was absolutely captivated by multiple sequences, in fact.

It feels like Cesar never changes over the entire film's runtime no matter what he goes through, and this is a major contributing factor to the film's conclusion feeling so hollow and unearned. I know, I know, this isn't the kind of film I should try and apply storytelling logic to, but I feel like I would have enjoyed it more on the whole if it leaned into the abstract entirely and didn't even bother with a narrative. Ultimately however, it's not about what I want, and I'm glad we got to see an old man's completely uncompromised and kooky vision unfold on the big screen.

Jojo Rabbit,5.0,"'What did they do?'
'What they could.'
I sobbed all the way through the credits. I couldn't even begin to compose myself. I was absolutely shaken to my core. And once I was able to find my footing and exit the theater, the first thing I did was buy a ticket to see it again.
Jojo Rabbit is a story of overcoming blind fanaticism and indoctrination, showcasing that monsters aren't born; they're made. They're manipulated. The transition Waititi's Adolf Hitler goes through over the course of the movie, from quirky companion to the furious, foaming-at-the-mouth espouser of hatred we know him as, illustrates the inner turmoil Jojo experiences as he grows to defy his twisted 'conscience'.
This is supported immensely by the fact that Roman Griffin Davis is an absolute star in the making. He nails every single comedic beat and dramatic moment with equal mastery. The performances are exceptionally great across the board, with Thomasin McKenzie and Scarlett Johansson being the two strongest supporting players. Both work wonders in their roles (and tragically share the screen too infrequently), providing Jojo with a more optimistic view on life than the twisted version he was taught.
The buffoonery of the Nazis is a point of contention among many reviewers, and their disdain for this aspect of the film is not unwarranted. However, I thought they were sufficiently portrayed as evil fanatics and that the jokes at their expense were accordingly funny. The comedy mostly worked for me; for every joke or visual gag that didn't land, there were five more that made me chortle both times I watched the film.
But shockingly, the sheer dramatic heft of the movie was its strongest attribute. I can't remember a film that moved me to tears to the same extent as this one. Jojo simply was an innocent boy indoctrinated into a worldview of hatred; he didn't deserve to be, and the rift between he and his mother was palpable and raw. Then we got to THAT scene, which has already cemented itself as one of my favorites in all of cinema.
Visuals, motifs, lines of dialogue, etc. are expertly reincorporated over the course of the movie, but nothing holds a candle to the magnificence of the ending, which is a strong contender for being my all-time favorite. Equal parts quirky, brilliant, and beautiful, it left me laughing and sobbing simultaneously, all while I came to the realization that no one else could have done what Taika did with this film. This is the masterpiece he was destined to make.
To summarize, Jojo Rabbit isn't a movie about the Holocaust. It isn't about the many atrocities committed by the Nazi party. It is simply about one little boy's journey to reject evil and allow love to triumph over hatred. This is what it chooses to be, and this is how I'm judging it. And to say it succeeds would be an understatement. It's the kind of movie that I'm never going to forget as long as I live; something so ludicrous, and yet, so unflinchingly honest.",True,0.092,0.75,0.158,0.9923

I feel like I barely know who these people are, since the plot is always the focal point of the film and there's little time to breathe.
Coming fresh off the game, I followed the plot well enough but I feel like there are so many details that just aren't explained particularly well, plus a lot of drawn-out sequences. The direction and cinematography were solid but could have veered a little further into the bizarre. Ultimately, it was cool to see the characters in live-action, but I feel like Ace Attorney would be better suited for a miniseries than a regular film.

Absurd that Isao Takahata's name does not carry the same level of reverence and awe from the general populace as Hayao Miyazaki's. I suppose it comes down to his masterpieces being fewer in number and far less marketable. Regardless, this is the ethereal, untouchable magnum opus of an artist at the pinnacle of his career.

Denis Villeneuve has this way of bypassing my absurdly short attention span in a way no other filmmaker can. Every scene he shoots is so compelling through its presentation and atmosphere that its overall relevance to the larger story is a moot point. I was glued to my seat during the entirety of what was arguably 2 and a half hours of setup. But when the setup is this rich and nuanced and thoroughly engrossing, how can I complain?
Definitely feels like the second part will be the more interesting story (idk tho I've never touched the book), and with a foundation this strong, I'm going to be in sheer agony waiting for the sequel. Blade Runner 2049 is still my favorite Villeneuve film but this is a close second. Fucking hell, this movie slaps.",True,0.109,0.71,0.181,0.9265
