0,Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,2025,3.0,“Chica where are you I need you”
1,Don’t Move,2024,1.0,Don’t watch 🙏
2,The Phoenician Scheme,2025,4.0,"Classic backhand layup.
Basketball
I remember waiting for my internship roommate who was taking a lot longer than usual to get off work and rushing to Regal. I hadn't seen a Wes Andersen in a while and was really looking forward to it after seeing an ad of Bryan Cranston and Tom Hanks playing basketball.
Business Jargon
The plot offers a unique situation involving businesses, which was 'utterly foreign' to me. In a story of complex corporate schemes and high-stakes…"
3,Se7en,1995,5.0,"Gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy.
Premise
The premise of Se7en revolving around the Seven Deadly Sins is arguably my favorite structural foundation in cinema. This framework effectively elevates the standard detective film into a powerful morality play and a grim philosophical commentary on human nature. The killer's disturbing, premeditated order intensifies the entire manhunt, creating a palpable tension that allowed my friend and I to play detective along with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in their roles.…"
4,La La Land,2016,3.0,"What do you mean you hate jazz?
Buildup
At first, the cliché of the Hollywood setting and the 'struggling artist' tropes almost saturates the film, and I thought the development of a romantic relationship would also end in a similar, predictable way. However, I appreciated the slow, natural buildup, and the quick, witty dialogue between the two main characters, which rooted the fantasy in relatable emotion.
Sacrifice
While La La Land attempts to demonstrate the necessary sacrifice for success, the…"
5,Nope,2022,3.0,"Don't look him in the eyes.
Spectacle
Heading into AMC, my friends and I were fresh off of Get Out's bone-chilling social commentary. We had big expectations for Nope since it seemed to share the same sci-fi and horror elements. The thrill met my excitement, such as Gordy's blood-splatter and Jean Jacket's digestion, but I felt as if Nope lacked a clear social critique. Keke Palmer stated that ""Nope is not really a movie you can explain"", which sums up…"
6,Longlegs,2024,3.5,"Crimson or clover.
Intensity
In the scene where Maika Monroe sees Nicolas Cage as Longlegs for the first time, her resting heart rate of 76 BPM reached 170. Monroe’s heartbeat plays over the interaction, underlining the intensity. Not just Monroe’s heartbeat, but also mine while viewing the film, signifies the intensity of Longlegs. The camera work, specifically the dolly zooms elevated the uncertainty of what was going to unfold.
90’s Nostalgia
From the start, director Oz Perkins immerses the viewer…"
7,Mad Max: Fury Road,2015,4.0,"I live. I die. I live again.
Cool Vs. Warm
The contrasting orange hue during the daytime versus blue at night defines Mad Max: Fury Road's visual style. The viewing experience features roughly an hour and a half of unfiltered action with explosions from vehicle warfare in the desert. Together, the film combines the warm and cool sides of the desert world-building with the bold reds of the War Boys' attire and grey metallic sheen of the vehicles, creating a…"
8,Monster,2023,4.0,"Happiness is something anyone can have.
Perspective
Kore-eda Hirokazu's Monster is an examination of how limited/self-serving perception fuels dehumanization. Through a rigorous game of narratives, a single crisis is dismantled to answer: ""Who is the monster?"" The compelling drama of the people involved in a fifth grader's life elevates philosophical profoundness, challenging the audience's understanding of each character.
Emotional Weight
The impact of the young leads in Monster is undeniable and essential. Soya Kurokawa, in particular, delivers a layered performance…"
9,Midsommar,2019,2.5,"It’s fine. It’s Sweden.
Ambience
The prolonged static shots and disorienting hazy visuals create the unsettling, dream-like aesthetic and convey the characters' drug-induced states. The vibrant flowers/background pop against the characters' white outfits. At one point, my sister was practicing Chopin’s Valse to Madame the Countess Delphine Potocka downstairs, adding an unexpected ambiance and tricked my friends and me into thinking it was part of the soundtrack.
Ari Aster
If Ari Aster did not direct Midsommar, I’m not sure its reputation would…"
10,Tokyo Godfathers,2003,4.5,"God must be busy at this time of year.
Pilgrimage
Tokyo Godfathers offers an original composition of principal characters: a middle-aged alcoholic, runaway teen, former drag queen, and abandoned newborn. All compelled by the helpless life of a baby, the three homeless strangers set on a pilgrimage toward their own redemption. Can things that are broken still be fixed? What follows is an endless string of seemingly impossible coincidences that can only be labeled as divine intervention.
Tradition
The profound…"
11,Magnolia,1999,2.5,"This cannot be one of those things.
Duration
The opening, with its philosophical setup on fate and chance, set a pretty high bar that the film's narrative couldn't clear in the end. The promise of profound coincidences in Magnolia evaporated over its runtime; my friends and I want our 3 hours back.
Dialogue
The individual character arcs were sometimes amusing, specifically the relationship between the Christian cop and emotionally-damaged woman, as well as the ""Seduce and Destroy"" guy. Even in…"
12,American Psycho,2000,2.5,"Eggshell with Romalian type.
Satirical Humor
Christian Bale describes American Psycho as ""brilliant, but farcical on many levels"" in an interview. While the satirical humor was enjoyable in select scenes, such as the business card exchange, I didn't find the brilliance that accompanied the dark humor of sex and murder all that appealing. As a director, Mary Harron's goal to ridicule the average Wall Street businessman and social system of 1980s New York City was successful; however, I didn't have as much fun as I thought I would have watching it. Hate-watching just isn't my forte. The disturbing lack of diversity in the West at that time is a realistic touch that can be appreciated.
Other
Christian Bale's American accent was surprisingly soothing. American Psycho's reputation would be saved if some enjoyers stopped idolizing the main character."
13,Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),2014,3.0,"You never know the particulars.
Continuity
Birdman feels as if it was filmed all in one continuous shot. The jazz drums scores, camera pans, and one-on-one dialogue transition well from scene to scene, but the heavy use of this formula isn't necessarily engaging for having friends over, especially when one of them falls asleep.
Ambiguity
Birdman's pursuit of past glory deepens his conflicting self-perception, setting up a final sequence that is hard to label. This narrative choice is the opposite…"
14,The Fifth Element,1997,3.5,"Follies, lollies, and lick-them-lollies.
Flamboyancy
Chris Tucker's role as a flamboyant radio host is the sole reason why he should be the sixth element. The slower pacing in the first-half of The Fifth Element is made up for by the fashion icon in a leopard print suit with a cannon design for his hair.
Character Design
The science fantasy tone is well-complemented by its villain designs, such as one antagonist's asymmetrical plastic headpiece and slicked-back hair. An opera scene accompanied…"
15,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,2003,5.0,"It's a forest, and it's easy to lose your way.
Visual Identity
The contrasting blend of monochrome, anime, and vibrant color grading define Kill Bill's visual identity. The 8 minute anime sequence reminded me of Samurai Champloo. The similarity in sharp and rough animation is not just a coincidence; Kazuto Nakazawa, the director of the animation segment, also served as the character designer and chief animation director for Samurai Champloo. Since Samurai Champloo is my favorite anime, I can't help…"
