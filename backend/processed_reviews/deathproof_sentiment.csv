The Chronology of Water,4.5,"AFI 2025: film #17
'before i hated him, i loved him'
the older i get, the more trauma i collect, the more grief i experience, the more i find myself haunted. memories slap me in the face out of left field, and one particularly sinister bad dream can ruin my whole day upon waking. the memories stack up in my mind, pushing old ones out to take up space, infecting my cranium like a virus that’ll never shake loose. and no matter how well i'm doing and how happy i am in life, these ghosts live with me now, unpacking their bags and settling down, and every day i adjust to their presence
all that to say, this surprised the fuck out of me. viscerally raw, like cracking open the subconscious like an egg just to see what pours out. the only thing i can think to compare it to cinematically is the work of lynne ramsay, my favorite director, and i don't make that comparison lightly. which definitely helps explain why this worked so well for me: the editing is organically erratic, splicing like it wants to wound. the sound design cracks like a whip, unyielding and intuitive. imogen poots throws down an unbelievable performance, oozing with pure electricity on gritty 16mm, tying the whole thing together with the kind of talent you always hope to find in a movie like this but rarely come across
and my first thought when it ended? that i'm not sure if i can ever watch this again. it's brilliant but deeply unpleasant. i often find no issue in revisiting uncomfortable films, as well as waving away ones that dwell too heavily in the morbidity and lack real worth. but this lays snugly somewhere in between, something i'm so glad i got to experience but need at least some time to digest. might read the book in the meantime. so yeah. super chill film, what a breezy watch",True,0.09,0.743,0.167,0.9695

been anticipating catching this doc all year and finally got my chance thanks to superfest, (where it's playing free all weekend on vimeo). i found it often hard to watch but quite informative, i agree with many reviews relating it to something that might appear on PBS, in a complimentary way. on a personal note, i can't remember the last time i cried for such a long time, broken only by the brief pauses i took to dry my eyes and wipe off my glasses. back as a disabled teenager i remember reading dozens of wikipedia articles about T4 and wondering why i hadn't heard more about it, why it wasn't an integral piece of widespread holocaust history. this answers many of those questions and hopefully helps forge a path forward for disabled people as a collective so we can educate, grieve, and strive for better. i definitively recommend this one as a 'must see' film",True,0.068,0.791,0.141,0.9293

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,5.0,"genuinely can't remember how long it's been since i've watched this in full, well over a decade according to my diary on this app. it was definitely watched with my dad, i think on dvd, in our living room. maybe my mom joined us, but probably not, it would have been too weird for her taste. i remember loving it instantly but maybe feeling a little too young for it to fully envelop me. it seems like i've lived many lives since that viewing, and have since embraced more than a few charlie kaufman films with open arms, falling in love with his morbid vision of the world. but this rewatch transported me back to beginning, since this was definitely my introduction to his writing, all those years ago on a day i can't even recall
what magic, conjured up and bottled. conceptually it's maybe the most accessible of kaufman's museum of cinematic oddities that i've seen, and emotionally solid to the core, managing to worm its way into the hearts of millions over the years. i thought i might not cry, and then clem starts to fade away, the two of them finally meeting for the first time and saying goodbye all at once. a packed house with many people sniffling loudly after the lights came up, and plenty of people crowding the sink in the women's room using wet paper towels to wipe away tear stains
i think what got to me, to get personal for a moment, is just how much my dreams nowadays blur the lines of reality and memory. having lost my mother a decade ago, and my brother almost a year ago, and more than a few beloved pets in between, i close my eyes every night and sometimes happen upon them, waiting to greet me, or haunt me. they show up, and my mind knows somewhere that they're gone, they're not coming back. that weird ache, that sensation of loss. and sometimes we speak about it, or i ask about it. why are you here? where did you go? how are you back? this isn't right, it's all wrong. memory is the most commonplace ghost on earth, and when memories shape my dreams it can make or break my day when i open my eyes
grief is a part of life and this film beautifully encapsulates grieving those who are still meandering around somewhere, trying not to think of us as we try not to think of them. loss in any form is profound, but it was cathartic for me to revisit such a film with new memories and losses of my own, many lives into the one i've got

All the Silence,4.0,"seen at the hola mexico film festival
our protagonist, miriam, is well embedded in the local deaf community, raised a CODA and even teaching sign language for work. as she begins to lose her hearing, the grief is tinged with inevitability, her denial only half-hearted as she struggles to join a world she's been adjacent to her entire life
what struck me the most, aside from the singular performance by adriana llabrés, is the focus on the relationships in her character's life. the coworker she befriends who has been deaf since birth, his perspective challenging her to see her 'loss of hearing' as something to adapt to, to shift the way she sees life and art. meanwhile, her girlfriend lola is hearing impaired and wears hearing aids, her parents raised her to speak and she never learned sign language. this contrast creates a genuine divide in their relationship, the friction caused by lola's firm belief to try and operate in the able bodied world, seeing herself as 'normal'. when miriam's hearing starts to dissipate, their mutual misunderstanding of each other intensifies and it's heart wrenching to witness
still, seeing her navigate the local intersecting queer and deaf communities, the world a blend of spoken spanish and mexican sign language, a whirl of bodies dancing and laughing, is a truly welcome surprise. i adore how much compassion was clearly poured into this film, making it a highlight for me in recent years. i highly highly recommend checking it out",True,0.055,0.8,0.146,0.9746

this remains one of the most impactful films i’ve yet to see in my life. i just turned 30, and most of my days so far i’ve spent isolated from other disabled people, surrounded by able bodied peers, trying to keep up in my wheelchair. trying, and often failing, to match their work ethic, energy levels, social lives. it is a high bar to set for myself, but it’s all i’ve known
at this event i was overwhelmed by solidarity, hearing disabled creative professionals discuss the industry and how vital it is that we continue to kick the doors down to participate, to be seen, to be heard, to be present both in front of and behind the camera
i’m so thankful for this movie and for this community. this experience was the exact dream i had in mind when i used to envision my life here. to be a part of something special, even for a day, even for a moment. i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again: this movie is essential viewing. and yes, i’m talking to you",True,0.02,0.852,0.127,0.9807

and i’m trying to avoid sharing any possible spoilers here because i think going in colder will probably be a richer experience, but i do have to say that the cut from black and white to color is an all timer for me. all things considered, this is probably yorgos’s most heartwarming and hopeful film to date. what a delicacy",True,0.089,0.76,0.151,0.9521

Sick of Myself,4.5,"a satirical stinger, both hilarious and horrific. narcissism dialed up so high that it teeters into munchausen territory. one surprising addition was the layered criticisms of able bodied people seemingly uplifting people with illness/disability, but only if they’re still outwardly conventionally attractive and profitable to them. when that stops being true their social niceties try to mask clear discomfort as they’re unsure of what they got themselves into, just as our protagonist, (if you even want to call her that), is unsure as well
i’ve read some reviews wishing that the final act packed a bit more of a punch, and while i understand the let down, i personally disagree. it felt fitting to see a character so privileged and vain doing such unspeakable things in an effort to garner attention from others and it falls flat. and it’s so interesting to sympathize with her when she’s suffering, but recoil upon remembering that the suffering is of her own creation. such a twisted experience",True,0.144,0.665,0.191,0.8706

Margaret,4.5,"a grueling but unexpected look at how trauma can inspire extreme waves of selflessness and selfishness. maybe it’s about this, and many other things too, making clear philosophical arguments while also leaving so much room for interpretation that its trajectory is often skating on the edge of aimless discomfort. a coming of age story so crushingly intimate until it pulls back and reveals how insignificant coming of age actually is. often lisa is the focus of a scene but the sounds happening around her drown her out completely as if she didn’t matter to begin with
after it ended i realized that in scope it feels like a kaufman film with a more subtle approach to its subject matter by letting the grand ideas speak for themselves (and if they do at all really depends on the viewer). it even suggests a kieślowski influence by intertwining an overall sense of responsibility to the people around us to tread carefully and choose our words more wisely. i vaguely recall putting this on some time in the past decade and not really understanding what it was going for, and now i feel mostly the opposite. neither opinion is really right or wrong because i think they coexist here and in this instance make sense. it feels like it’s about nothing and everything all at once, and maybe that’s why i liked it so much
this has one of the most interesting protagonists i’ve seen in a long time. she’s a lot to stomach, think lady bird but with even less emotional control. in a way it’s infuriating and the performance can even seem aggressively over the top, but in hindsight this might be anna paquin’s best role to date and proves how wildly talented she really is. here she plays someone who already doesn’t know how to truly relate to anyone or show emotion in healthy ways, and then early in the film experiences trauma so quickly and severely that it shapes her whole existence, at least for a little while. she lets her feelings tumble out violently and chooses her words recklessly in nearly every conversation, crying out for emotional support that she won’t accept and begging for solutions that don’t exist
if communication is key then this film is an uncrackable lock. being misunderstood is so singularly frustrating, and even more so when grieving or trying to make sense of senseless everyday horrors. the genius of putting a self absorbed (but good hearted) teenager at the center of this moral epic cannot be understated as it puts every moment into perfect perspective, especially in new york city of all places. it suggests that the pain and suffering we’re experiencing can simultaneously be the most important and least important thing in the world, however dramatic that may seem. we exist inside of our own heads and bodies alone but can’t forget that everyone else does too. and that’s one of the great beauties and tragedies of life

Nomadland,4.5,"best picture marathon: film #8
“because she loved rocks”
this truly feels less like a movie and more like a fond but hazy memory, which might be why it’s so special in my eyes. life is mostly made up of memories we recount all alone in the quiet, and otherwise we’re busy distracting ourselves to keep from thinking about them. this honors those memories and gives itself over to a protagonist who chooses to live inside of them while on her journey. always choosing to wear its heart proudly on its sleeve, this is simply a story about people doing their best to get by in a way that also makes them feel happy and free. chloé zhao captured and created absolute magic with this one and i think it deserves all the love it’s receiving",True,0.029,0.657,0.314,0.995

“you saved my life. you made it beautiful”
i’ve seen many films tackle the subject of change, but never quite like this. the narrative here unfolds more like reality, the lead character riding waves of distress alongside occasional moments of joy and acceptance as he struggles to decide his next move. life is not a straight line, it’s messy and unpredictable and fucking scary, and this paints that picture in a really balanced way. and it’s pretty remarkable when a film can center itself firmly on both a character and that character’s most vital relationship, but this makes it look easy. there’s a small moment where olivia cooke’s character stares at the protagonist as he struggles with his new reality, and the pain she feels with him and for him is clear as day. this is such a heart wrenching film, but it also emphasizes finding stillness wherever you are and amidst whatever life is throwing at you. and that is just superb",True,0.128,0.663,0.209,0.9638

The Trial of the Chicago 7,2.5,"best picture marathon: film #5
“i’ve never been on trial for my thoughts before”
the biggest piece of oscar bait in the bunch, but i was expecting that all along. it has its moments of triumph when the music swells and i’m momentarily won over, but otherwise this is just too much courtroom and isn’t worth the runtime. sorkin scripts are usually overwhelming at times but this one is especially wordy and feels needlessly distracting, like we get it, you’re a screenwriter. and he clearly isn’t the strongest director which makes this uninteresting as a whole. i will say the actors do a pretty impressive job with the material given, but i just know that i’ll be forgetting about this the second the oscars are over",True,0.018,0.761,0.22,0.9858
Promising Young Woman,1.0,"best picture marathon: film #4
“you’re right, ok? is that what you wanna hear?”
i’m of the opinion that this is an irresponsible movie. it doesn’t really matter to me if i think it’s well made or piss poor, because in the end it just stings with that carelessness. for months i’ve been weighing it on my tongue and mulling it over, and i’ve realized that it only tastes worse every day. and upon rewatch i discovered that i can’t even accept it as a study of grief or self sabotage in the wake of loss when the ending is just too much to stomach. at one point i thought it would work better as a flat out horror movie, at least then its mixed messages would likely operate better within that genre. but here it’s just a glitzy mess, too obsessed with drilling the point home that it completely collapses in on itself
it feels like the only intention here is to shame the audience over and over again, and in response to feeling that shame many voters in various spaces have gifted it with a slew of nominations, including at the academy awards. i’m not really saying it doesn’t deserve the nominations, (or even the awards), but in a nutshell this feels to me like the most easily digestible ‘me too’ movie yet, more aggressive and well directed than bombshell but with still no real statement to make, both vague and flashy simultaneously so that the final credits rolling are supposed to inspire shock and awe. but it honestly just makes me feel uncomfortable. it tries and has its moments but is overall unable to charm me, and i doubt it ever will as i have no intention of revisiting this any time soon
i’m gonna end this like i ended my last review of this movie, with recommendations: if you’d like a 2020 movie that handles this subject matter with more subtle grace then i highly recommend the assistant. or if bloody revenge is more your thing, revenge (2017) is definitely worth a watch. for b-movie horror similar to this i’d check out american mary. and finally the series i may destroy you, which i haven’t been brave enough to watch myself yet but have only heard stellar things about and plan to watch soon. i just don’t recommend this, that much i know for sure, and it really bums me out",True,0.148,0.69,0.162,0.8457

Zack Snyder’s Justice League,4.0,"the interesting thing about snyder is that he always swings big: whether it results in a colossal whiff or a home run just depends on the particular project, amount of creative control, and audience reception. but he always puts his unique style into it, and for that reason i’ve really grown fond of his stuff. his involvement in the dceu has kept me interested, and i still have fun with both their best content or biggest flops. too often nowadays blockbusters, and especially franchise films, fall completely in the middleground and feel a bit too safe creatively, and the effect makes me feel empty and bored. the mcu is guilty of this, and the original cut of justice league suffers as well because of joss being brought in to finish it
comparing the original version to this is like day and night. some of the bones are still here, but the editing has completely changed the DNA: for instance, a heroically cheesy early scene featuring wonder woman and some bad guys has become grim and purposeful here, reminiscent of the dark knight’s thrilling opening sequence. and with the extra hours allotted there is plenty of time for world building both big and small. more backstories, mythology and villainry are packed in to be sure, but i especially loved that even the side characters get to experience their emotional moments of truth. my favorite aspect of this cut might be the league itself and how the dynamics have changed: the first version relies too heavily on humor and it feels forced, the connections never fully occur and it rings hollow. but here they take each other seriously and grow a camaraderie and respect, at first having trouble getting into the group mindset but eventually working together seamlessly. they look out for each other and work towards a common goal, and when the humor does come out between them it feels organic and earned.
to wrap it up i have to admit that i’m just happy it exists. this is the justice league i was hoping for before the original came out, and while it’s still far from perfect it successfully satisfied me and even left me wanting more. it drops the bright and glossy hollywood shine and in turn loses most of the resemblance to its former self, fully morphing into a desaturated snydery melodrama: and i’m fully on board. it also casts an overall spell in a way that these films usually can’t quite pull off, both grimly atmospheric and monumental, reminding me more of lord of the rings than any superhero movie i can recall. if you don’t like superhero stuff, the dceu or snyder i’d tread lightly, then again you might be surprised. but i love these characters and i’m glad they got this moment to shine. and personally speaking i think these four hours do a better job than the avengers did with four movies. and cinematically speaking it’s definitely the winner as well",True,0.073,0.692,0.235,0.9987

“you won’t find anyone like me”
i’m completely floored. i’ve been terrified of watching this the entire festival, fearing the worst, and while this is an extremely difficult watch in terms of both sex and sexual assault/violence i never once felt that we weren’t supposed to have empathy for the protagonist in those situations. sofia kappel (in her first acting role ever) is magnetic and perfectly cast, and behind the camera ninja thyberg masterfully maps out every scene. together they made this intense as wildfire, both beautiful and dangerous, something that i couldn’t tear my eyes away from even when they began to water and burn
the unflinching look at the sex industry is deeply unsettling but also normalizes it for women in a way that i haven’t seen properly portrayed in such a film before. it shows situations with high professionalism where consent and respect are key, and then flips the script to address the pressures of being the only woman on a risky set that takes a horrifying turn. the balanced perspective keeps this realistic as we follow the lead from quiet daily routines to glamorous slow motion photoshoots. it explores broad themes like ambition, friendship, trauma and power while also making it clear that the industry has plenty of toxic sexism and racism at its core. the protagonist chooses this path for herself and we witness her contemplative moments of doubt and fear, but she controls her life and chooses it again and again. it isn’t meant to seem like a mistake or a tragedy but instead a choice. her relationships with the women around her are the most complex and interesting by far, the competition and power struggles providing one of her most intricate hurtles. one of my only problems with the film is the lack of perspective from women of color and/or trans women, this focusing on a white woman who chooses to join the glamorous and famous side of the industry instead of a woman who might have less of a choice or is much more at risk. besides that i can’t think of much else i would criticize (for now) except for how far it pushes boundaries, but without that i feel in this case like it would lose authenticity and purpose 
the second the film ended i couldn’t dive into the q&a fast enough, making it the only one of the fest i truly sought out. and watching it only solidified my fascination with the film as the director addresses different aspects of it with a clear perspective. about bella’s desire to join the sex industry, ninja said she didn’t want to psychoanalyze the character and try to delve into “what’s wrong with her”, this decision lets the protagonist choose her line of work free of prejudice from the filmmaker (and audience) standpoint. and about the choice of music (which is a mix of opera/hip-hop, all original for the movie i assume because i desperately tried to find the songs afterwards and had no luck), the director compared society viewing women singing opera to be the highest form of art, (with porn being the lowest), and wanted to merge the two, “opera is women moaning, but it’s fine art”. comments like these gave me more confidence in the film overall, the intentions behind it clearly purposeful and full of agency and respect in regards to sex work while also staying critical about the internal problems within the industry
whew, i had a lot to say about this, but it still feels like i’m only scratching the surface. this is most definitely not for everyone. it’s absolutely fucking relentless, but i also found it to be made with a deep level of respect, empathy and intelligence as well. not everyone will feel this way about it, that i already know for sure. this feels to me like a perfect example of an uncomfortable film being rewarding and artistic underneath. i hope it gets picked up so you can choose if you’d like to see it for yourself",True,0.118,0.72,0.162,0.9884

But I’m a Cheerleader,5.0,"i’ve probably seen the original cut of this movie over a dozen times, and it’s only gotten better since the first time i stumbled upon it. but for perspective, this review is focused on the new director’s cut because (and i’m surprised to say) it kind of rules
the first thing i have to mention is the COLOR: it POPS! the original quality always felt a little lacking and never seemed to be in hd (no surprise considering the time it was made), so this remaster thankfully boasts not just overall quality and sharpness but a beautiful boost in saturation. the pinks and blues are more gorgeous than ever, as are the rest of the colors of the rainbow. i was almost distracted by it in the best way, it feels like the original vision finally coming to light
and about the director’s cut itself: there are numerous deleted scenes and even a few scene extensions. for the deleted scenes, jamie babbit said she was nervous that people would be bored if it was too long, so she cut scenes that she always loved (including but not limited to a guitar sing-a-long of megan’s “god is good, god is straight” cheer, and an informational video welcoming her to true directions. a part of me thinks that was zachary quinto’s voiceover during that bit?? i could be completely wrong!) and for the extended scenes, the director has spoken a lot before (namely in the documentary this film is not yet rated) about the mpaa initially (and unjustly) slapping an nc-17 rating on the film for a few shots in the sex scene, which i noticed here seems to be back in original form. a lot of various other scenes are extended and with all those small new pieces working together it just feels a lot more complete as a film
so with that i really recommend checking out this version, even if you’re seeing this movie for the first time. i’m a big fan of the original but this just made it even more enjoyable for me, which is something i didn’t see coming considering how minor the changes seem in scope. it’s definitely one of the only films that continues to grow on me with time, and this only helped with that",True,0.048,0.746,0.205,0.9974

Run,4.0,"in today’s world this feels like a familiar story, echoing both fiction like sharp objects and real stories like gypsy rose blanchard, but that familiarity doesn’t make it any less potent here. i was skeptical, not wanting to indulge this worn out plot that seemingly exists only to mystify and thrill able bodied audiences. but i’m excited to say that’s not exactly what i found in this case
my first discovery here was that newcomer kiera allen acts circles around sarah paulson. the latter is clearly the selling point, her name all over the advertising in big bold letters, “look at sarah paulson go, look at her cry, look at her scream”, fleshing out the kind of sadistic and melodramatic role that she’s best at. but seeing a real wheelchair user maneuver nightmare scenarios and experience all levels of terror was something i’ve never really experienced before. and i’m not gonna lie, it makes all the difference for me. this isn’t just joey king wearing big glasses, or kevin mchale climbing out of his prop wheelchair in a dream sequence to dance. this is someone that pushes off walls with her arms in tight spaces and rounds sharp corners on a dime. does being disabled make her a good actor? of course not, but the good news is that she is a good actor. the whole movie rests solely on kiera allen’s shoulders, and she carries it boldly and independently while sarah pounds on the door outside
i don’t talk about my disability all that often in online spaces, only truly out of habit because these online spaces have been my biggest escape from the limitations that come with being disabled in the real world. but seeing fragments of yourself represented on screen when you so rarely are is a powerful feeling, like gasping for air when you didn’t realize you were being held underwater. on it’s own, this film is a thrilling enough ride, aptly made and successfully placing us in the shoes of the main character, fearing sarah paulson like we’re so used to doing. but the choices made with casting (and small specifics in things like writing and set design) changed the overall feeling for myself and possibly for others like me who relate to these particular struggles. for able bodied audiences they might as well be watching a slasher film, or any b-movie thriller. but every day i face small obstacles like some of the ones shown here: a staircase laid out in front of me as if to taunt me, or a set of front wheels buried deep in mud. can’t get out of a car unless the person i’m with gets my chair out for me, and even in the best scenarios that can still feel crushingly isolating and even momentarily scary at times
does a part of me wish the story here was a bit different? of course i do. but there’s something to be said for small change happening slowly with stories that we’re already well aquatinted with. yes, on the surface this is just a mother-daughter thriller, but the brilliant performance by a disabled actor makes it shine. and yes, a movie like the upcoming happiest season is just a safe holiday rom-com, but the lgbt representation might make all the difference for a community that has never seen itself in that beloved and comforting sub-genre, just like i’d never seen a real life disabled final girl until tonight, and didn’t even realize how much i wanted to. not everything has to be a grand movement, a monumental shift that shakes us to our core with bold statements and unique outlooks, no matter how much we desire that as soon as we can get it (or create it ourselves). small steps leave a softer but lasting impression, something that might not make waves with its originality but will quietly stick with those who relate to it. and some people can mock cries for representation in media if they like, but the reality is that until we’re all able to see ourselves on screen (and behind it) we won’t all be able to fully grasp the real power of visual storytelling and what a welcoming relief it is to be able to relate to it",True,0.051,0.761,0.188,0.9989

Tenet,,"“don’t try to understand it”
very few filmmakers in the world have as much creative control as christopher nolan does on this scale, and when this ended that became abundantly clear. the reason being because this final edit is so incoherent that not only does it take research afterwards to fully figure out, but the sound mixing drowns out most of the dialogue completely. not that the dialogue is very helpful to begin with, it only added to the confusion for me in most scenes where i could even make out the words. after some reflection i think i like and kind of understand the plot, but i think the way he wrote the script (especially the dialogue) was ridiculously all over the place
i wonder if nolan has no one to tell him how incoherent this was, or he just doesn’t care and has finally reached the ultimate level of blockbuster pretentiousness that he’s been headed towards for well over a decade now. either way, i can only see two outcomes to this as a viewer in the moment: shake it off and forget about it and how needlessly convoluted it was, or dig deeper and try to understand and see if the digging is even worth it. i’m gonna do the latter, because this year has already been such a mess and deprived us all of so many movie experiences that i don’t mind putting a little extra time into just one. i’ve never been so excited to rewatch a movie with subtitles on

the plot here is incoherent and the effects are silly, and it absolutely works. characters point their fingers at the viewer, things fly wildy into the screen. it’s goofy and it’s a gimmick, but it’s self aware (just like the rest of the series) and definitely a better 3D ride than sharkboy and lavagirl. this kind of experience reminds me of being a kid and it was exciting just to revisit. also looking at it now? this kind of accidentally paved the way for pacific rim and ready player one among others. and that’s the power of spy kids",True,0.031,0.809,0.161,0.9827

“i’m sorry”
“me too”
an absolute stunner. every line was written with care to seamlessly blend comedy and tragedy together. it sometimes comes off as almost too polished (that SCORE!) but grounds itself once again in the realism of how fast things can go from bad to worse. adam driver is particularly good, but my favorite performance has to be laura dern, getting to stretch her legs here with material much better than what big little lies season 2 gave her
a few key scenes in this are so dramatic that the outcome with these skilled actors going toe to toe is almost unbelievable. the calm always returns, but the thunderous dialogue is still ringing in my ears. this isn’t my favorite film of the year, but i have to admit that it’s pretty fucking close",True,0.086,0.733,0.181,0.9353

surface level fare for audiences that crave some shock value but aren’t willing to go looking for something better, or deeper. i didn’t feel much of anything the entire duration, indifference turning to eventual boredom. the last act definitely gave me something more to work with, but by that point i’d already lost all interest and just wanted to get out of there. joaquin is always good at playing unhinged, sure, but i’d pass on this performance any day of the week for you were never really here or even the master. the former film has what this never could: nuance, intrigue and something to say",True,0.069,0.763,0.169,0.9337

not a joke in the slightest: this is one of the best films of the year. a movie with a premise like this could have been made in a million horrible ways, but this is a perfect example of how good something can be when treated just right. it’s engaging from the first scene until the cut to black. everyone is a star player, j-lo is ridiculously great and even cardi b and miss riverdale bring comedic moments that land every time. and the whole thing is tied up in a plot so warm that i’m genuinely taken aback. you have to see this thing for yourself",True,0.081,0.714,0.205,0.9659

recently i’ve been thinking a lot about how horror movies are usually either truly scary or truly well made, and so rarely both. this is the rare occasion for me when i feel it fits into both categories naturally, churning out terrifying sequences but also giving me something interesting to look at and chew over. a coming of age horror movie, and a mainstream remake (or adaptation) at that, how surprised i initially was to find that this was as enjoyable as it was uneasy to watch. it definitely held up after a few years, and i can only hope that the second chapter clicks as well (let’s go chastain let’s GO)",True,0.104,0.685,0.211,0.9267
Teen Spirit,4.5,"“a lot of people like to sing. you can sing”
was fully anticipating feeling mildly apathetic about this, but then they opened the movie with genesis by grimes and i was a fool by tegan and sara. back to back. this COMPLETELY won me over, from the saturated colors to the killer soundtrack. the right balance of hazy neon and introspective moments of quiet. i could feel the flaws under the surface, a little clumsy here and there, and cliche as well, but none of that phased me at all. and i do seem to enjoy the hell out of elle fanning no matter what kind of role she’s in
all in all, this was an absolute blast and hit just right: a vox lux reality show that’s much more digestible, or a really artful disney channel original movie. and i mean that in the most complimentary way possible",True,0.118,0.75,0.132,0.3626

the most ridiculous thing about living is that childhood is its own eternity and then suddenly you’re an adult. time moves faster and faster and life is sectioned off into sleeping eating working blinking repeating, and deja vu happens more and more. i forget what day of the week it is all the time. i sleep until after 5pm some days just because i can. i can go into a store and buy whatever they’ll let me and whatever i have the money for. nothing means anything but also everything means something. i work so hard and get paid almost nothing. i stare into space between customers and think of being somewhere else. i just had a birthday and i keep forgetting how old i am, and when i remember, i get kind of upset. i also forget that i have a bone disease and all the complications it brings along with it. i even forget sometimes that i’m in a wheelchair. it’s just my reality. it always has been. it all comes flooding in at once sometimes and i feel overwhelming self-pity before i have to shove it all away. being gay and people knowing that about me brings me such stress that i wrote about it here, edited it out, and decided to write it back in. all i do is work and wait around. all i do is want things i can’t have. i often wish i was somewhere else, i wish i was different. i feel trapped, i don’t like it. for just a split second in the scope of time i exist, and then i’ll be gone. am i lucky to be here, or am i cursed? why is living so hard? surely it shouldn’t be this hard, feel this strained. time moves so rapidly now, and it’s only moving faster as i grow older. there is nothing more terrifying than that, i think. more and more i think about all the people in my life i love and never see, never make the time for. it brings me pain. i sit and want and plan and don’t act and time keeps moving. wasted minutes, years. the last decade, vanished, gone forever. i didn’t go to high school, i was homeschooled but didn’t do much. my youth slipped through my fingers. regret is like a weight i carry around with me. i try my best not to let it pull me down. i need to try and live in the moment. i need to change my life, it’s not going to change on its own. i need to stop crying over this movie, it ended over an hour ago. the past few years of my life have been pivotal and joyous in comparison to the decade that preceded them. i have dear friends i spend much of my time with and i often travel alone and experience wonder. i can do whatever i want. i don’t want to settle. i should keep that in mind. i should live while i’m alive. this was a really long paragraph but i don’t care. anyways, have a nice day. this movie is objectively good",True,0.084,0.8,0.116,0.9749

Vox Lux,4.5,"“it was not her grief; it was theirs. no longer merely her experience, they reclaimed it as their own”
tragedy gave her wisdom, and stardom took it away. or at least changed it, morphed it into something else. the loss of innocence in exchange of fame, becoming the key cog in a perfectly oiled machine. the purpose of the machine is distraction: manufacturing happiness for a world that wants to ignore the ugliness and pain. at one point a young celeste pops a painkiller and hops on a stairmaster, the pop music her headphones blares into her ears drowning out the bleak news channel droning on in the background
a lot of this is realistically kind of messy, but i love that about it. all these various possible metaphors crammed into the persona of a fictional popstar. completely riveting. we never even get much real insight to the music itself: what it means, especially to her. because in the end, does it really matter? the last song finds the crowd joining in, their combined voices overpowering celeste until we can’t hear her at all. the music she (or anyone) makes becomes it’s own entity, belonging to the world now. it doesn’t even have to be good, because people will cling to whatever bits of happiness they can get their hands on to make it through. and when she performs, she finally seems complete. because sharing that happiness with the world is the only thing she was designed to do",True,0.056,0.811,0.132,0.9764

“so, we gonna do this thing or what?”
i can totally understand how some might like adam mckay’s style, but i doubt i could like it any less. there are some interesting moments mixed in, glimmers of captivating editing choices and some cool shots, but are surrounded by too many stupid and aimless decisions: various kinds of fonts used on the pop up texts and way too many shifts in tone, songs that end seconds after they begin. it’s jarring and aggravating to me, like popcorn stuck between two teeth
by the end, i was fuming. overall this felt like the opposite of illuminating, regardless of the real way they felt about the subject matter, all of it clouded in too much incoherent obscurity. i really couldn’t care less if adam is hailed as some kind of a fresh voice in cinema, because all i hear is white noise",True,0.104,0.728,0.169,0.8825

sure, it’s somewhat harmless, but it bothers me so because it lacks in almost every way: uninspiring, uninteresting, undeserving. i’m tempted to give it half a star, but bumped it up because mahershala ali truly brings his a-game to every role he plays. otherwise, this brings me nothing but exhaustion. we can do better than this, we owe ourselves that much",True,0.056,0.725,0.219,0.9728

Bohemian Rhapsody,1.0,"best picture showcase: film #3
“don’t you see what you could be?”
the only allure here for me is that queen’s music is pretty good, and it also acts as the glue that haphazardly holds it all together. the first time i saw it i was charmed by the musical scenes (and also had no idea about the numerous controversies the film has surrounding it like a wasp hive), but over time i realized this has almost nothing else of value or substance to offer: the dialogue is cheap and fake, the plot is so poorly paced and the editing is incredibly embarrassing when focused in on. you can easily guess that members of queen had a part to play behind the scenes, because at times it comes off so trite that it’s a borderline parody. and it feels like a disservice to freddie in almost every way, many of the choices made leave a bad taste in my mouth
overall my personal opinion now has to be that the musical performances tricked the masses (perhaps including myself) into believing this was something special, when a closer look reveals it to be a huge mess in almost every way. it might have been some kind of passion project for some of the people involved, but the end result still feels like such a cheap grab at a few bucks and some awards season glory that it’s almost laughable, even if it once had potential. to each their own, but i can’t imagine choosing this as a movie to adore over so many others",True,0.086,0.753,0.161,0.9768

a bold statement: i think this has worth. i’m just as surprised as you might be, but when the initial annoyance wore off, i found myself caught up in what it has to offer. the david fincher version is one of my all time favorite films, so naturally it was really hard to adjust to this at first, but then i realized something: i can separate the two and see this for what it is
it was a weird decision to even go through with making this, the change is overly apparent in every frame and every brick is torn apart and rebuilt into a more standard americanized thriller rather than the chilly slow burn mystery fincher previously laid down. that one is arguably a masterpiece, but once the two are separated, this is quite a decent watch. watered down is the term i feel the most here, but fede alvarez is still a strong director all on his own. his previous two films feel stronger in style, but this is still slick and thrilling. and at it’s weakest moments, i was still entertained
compared to fincher’s film, this could very well be a slight embarrassment, but compared to many average thrillers that are churned out these days? it’s surprisingly enjoyable. imagine if they had adapted the first novel for a third time and ruined it all the more. instead this is kind of its own animal. and i like that",True,0.087,0.75,0.164,0.9723

but the ugliest part is how it lacks direction after the first few scenes try to entice: what clearly tries to be an honest portrayal of a young boy (that shows only truth, free from judgement) turns into a cautionary tale fast. at certain points this is sloppy and unpleasant to watch, the highest highs (friendship! and skateboarding!) never outweighing the lowest lows. and our protagonist is never really treated with true care, only mishandled and thrown into every situation to either sink or swim. it doesn’t feel like realism to me, it feels irresponsible. masculinity is a hell of a drug",True,0.106,0.692,0.202,0.9724

the thing about the original that’s drawn people in for 40 years is how well it’s crafted: the music, the specific angles and the way the camera swings around. the tension and the mystery of it. but like so many before and after it, this one genuinely great movie fell victim to franchising, which always waters the original down if the rest are compared to it
but honestly? my biggest issue here is my complete lack of interest in michael myers himself: in the original, the mystery works for a single movie, but a lot of that is still due to how well rounded that film came out. the character himself however is still so one-note that i couldn’t get into this at all. in the 1978 version, he was just scary enough for the one movie. but this kind of particular slasher character loses steam fast with me. and this new movie isn’t that good on its own anyways: the plot is lifeless and the dialogue choppy. laurie has a few decent scenes near the end, but by then it’s already too late for me

this killed me just like everyone knew it would. everything here is near perfect, and the power plays are absolutely ridiculous. the whole audience was laughing wildly during almost every scene. and it’s rare for me to thoroughly enjoy all lead characters in a film, but the three actresses really get to stretch their legs in these roles: i’ve never loved (and hated) emma stone more, and rachel weisz is brilliant as usual. and olivia colman brought emotional depth to what could have been such a dull one-note character. the combination of any or all of them had me on the edge of my seat for every single scene
hilarious and genuinely captivating, it just gets sillier until it doesn’t anymore. and it wasn’t until the end that yorgos pulled another lobster on me: i thought i was just having a good time, but without realizing it, i got sucked into a kind of love story. that’s what really drove the movie home for me, how connected i suddenly felt to the characters near the end. i was on the brink of crying and that feeling just snuck up on me and stayed

pieced together so well and told with so much truth, this was a really affecting experience. starts as a look at censorship and develops into something much deeper and maybe even more sinister: a look at the films themselves in the first 70 or so years of cinema, and the toxic patterns that repeat over and over in such a male dominated industry. so riveting i wish i could watch it again right now and show it to everyone i know",True,0.041,0.875,0.084,0.5346
Cold War,4.0,"CIFF 2018: film #4
“i’ve been waiting for you”
a far more engrossing love story than i was expecting. the kind of sickening love between two people who often can’t stand to be together, but  can’t bare to live apart. there’s no real happy, no real answer to their problem. the fleeting excitement of reuniting time after time is the height of their long shared journey, and the rest is as much a mystery to us as it is to them
the final act wraps up kind of fast, but besides that, it’s an incredibly solid film. the song she sings and how it develops and changes like a theme song throughout the years really helps keep track of time: like an ever present ghost in the character’s lives, always looming a little too close. and by the time this thing ended, i realized how invested i was, and the credits felt like a punch in the gut",True,0.105,0.73,0.165,0.914
Roma,5.0,"CIFF 2018: film #3
“it sounds like this. and smells the same”
completely breathtaking from the first frame to the last. the little in between moments of every day life make this what it is. a film almost full of those moments, and i could watch hours more of them. rain as seen through a window, water dripping into the kitchen sink, and waves thunderously crashing on the beach. a whole film drenched in perpetual wonder, even in it’s darkest moments
and this clearly goes without saying, but the photography in this is absolutely gorgeous. so often i found myself wishing i had an extra set of eyes to catch everything that was happening on screen at once. the black and white grounds it, and instead of sending you back in time, it brings it’s time and place to you. the feeling of being home and the heart, humor, and heartache that comes with it
this is undoubtedly the best film of 2018 i’ve seen yet. i was hoping i would love it, but i wasn’t ready for how it drew me in. i haven’t been this moved by a film in almost a year now. in a perfect world, this would already be a lock for best picture, but i’ll accept best actress buzz for yalitza aparicio, even if it’s not going to happen either. i’ve rarely seen a performance that deserves acclaim and admiration more. when she (and marina de tavira) came out after the film to do their q&a, the entire crowd gave yalitza a 3 minute standing ovation, and it should have been 10",True,0.007,0.781,0.212,0.997

“what kind of man leaves his wife and child in such a lonely place?”
at some point while growing up, everyone eventually realizes that their parents are not just their parents. they’re people with their own demons and problems that just happened to have a kid, or a few. and some even discover, to their horror, how messy their parents can be, or have been all along
the messy decline in this happens a little suddenly, but it still rings true. carey mulligan and the way she delivers her (brilliantly written) dialogue is a highlight. her spiral is a thing to behold. and i was lucky enough to see her at the theater tonight for a q&a as well (she also passed me in the hallway but wouldn’t make eye contact with me. i guess our wedding is postponed) also, this is truly a beautifully framed movie. makes it even more meaningful, especially the almost claustrophobic closeups. if i didn’t already know, i wouldn’t even guess this was a directorial debut",True,0.057,0.785,0.158,0.9767
Bad Times at the El Royale,4.0,"“which side are you on?”
lots of people have already compared the style of this to tarantino, so i won’t, but this is my subtle way of doing it anyway. this was way too enjoyable, but mostly because of how slick it’s pieced together. extremely well crafted, especially for how it comes off when you catch the trailer before another movie or just a promotional image of shirtless chris hemsworth. someone remind me later to rewatch the cabin in the woods before october is over",True,0.0,0.923,0.077,0.7869
A Nightmare on Elm Street,4.5,"“what the hell are dreams anyway?”
i really don’t care how corny this actually is, the concept alone terrifies me. so much so that i’ve actively feared watching it for years. it wasn’t all that scary to actually watch now, but instead thankfully rode the perfect line between spooky and campy. i unapologetically loved this, and the startling dream concepts within the movie are so original and horrific and sometimes hilarious that i was completely drawn in from start to finish. and a highlight of the screening: the whole audience broke into hysterical laughter when nancy pulled the coffee maker out from under her bed",True,0.141,0.589,0.269,0.9662

The Lobster,5.0,"“we’ll find a way”
tonally one of the most fitting films of this decade. the first half is so bleak but certain moments make me laugh every time, and by the time our protagonist is in the woods, it blossoms into a full blown love story while still keeping its dry absurdity. what was working already as a completely new kind of film experience becomes more profound: you always want what you can’t have. this time i even surprised myself by crying. multiple times",True,0.042,0.782,0.176,0.9245
A Star Is Born,3.5,"“is that me?” 
“that’s you”
more than anything, this film signifies the start of awards season for me. the massive hype around it, outcries that claim it’s a masterpiece. a part of me wishes i had a similar emotional reaction to it, but i didn’t feel too much of anything for the duration. the first half does give off an exciting aura (the concert scenes are captivating), but while we follow the passage of time in the film, i lost even more interest, and mostly in the characters, who felt slightly hollow. i found it hard to grow attached to them, even though the performances were maybe the strongest aspect of the film
the final act, however, loses me entirely. it’s the kind of ending you either love, or hate, or probably both. i felt nothing at all, except maybe a little contempt for it happening at all, a feeling aimed at the writing instead of the characters and their actions. it’s such an ill placed oscar bait ending to me that when my friends asked what i thought of the movie during the end credits, i wordlessly cast out an imaginary fishing pole
yet despite all my issues, lady gaga gives such a naturalistic performance, and the music isn’t bad at all. it has some truly thrilling moments and i had a good time, for a while at least. this might have left a bad taste in my mouth, but i don’t think it’s that bad of a film. and i’m glad people are feeling connected to it. sometimes that’s enough",True,0.109,0.73,0.161,0.9329

i have such a complicated relationship with this movie. fun fact: 11 year old lucy left the theater after the midnight screening and started crying out of sheer disappointment! that’s how much i love the book, and they left so much of the book out of the movie that it blindsided me at the time. but to be fair, the book is massive compared to the first three, and this does it’s best to bring the first dark cloud of the series finally ominously wafting in during the final act. the script isn’t my favorite at all though, a lot of the humor missing something and a lot of the most important moments lacking depth. however, over the years we’ve been working on our relationship and i’m finally in a good place to enjoy it for what it is. except harry’s hair. who’s fucking idea was that",True,0.039,0.789,0.172,0.9782
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,5.0,"(part of the harry potter weekly double feature)

the first film in the series to pop up when you search “harry potter” on letterboxd, and for good reason. when i first saw this in the theater as a kid i was unsure of all the changes it made from the first two movies, but it’s only grown on me over the years. alfonso cuarón brings more to the table here than any other director in the series, the close-ups, bold contrasts and heavy use of pouring rain start to warn us that things are changing for harry, so we better prepare ourselves
and already one of the most enjoyable books in the series, this has a perfect script to go with it. the lightness and darkness is balanced by some of the most natural performances and insightful little moments, whether it’s harry crying alone in the snow, or the contagious laughter of a bunch of 13 year old hogwarts kids. and buckbeak’s flight remains one of the best pieces of score in the whole series. goosebumps every time",True,0.072,0.773,0.154,0.9698
Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone,5.0,"(part of the harry potter weekly double feature)
this really got me. not a lot of people know this about me anymore, but harry potter was probably the biggest pop culture influence on my childhood. 12 whole years of it. it’s a common occurrence for someone around my age, but it was such a special, sacred thing to me. after the last movie, i left the theater and knew i had to let it go. i had just turned 17, and had let the series consume my childhood since i was 5. it was a natural parting, there was nothing left of it for me to hold onto it so tightly. no more new books, no more new movies. i sobbed in a movie theater at 3am, and then said goodbye for a while. but recently i’ve been wanting to rewatch. i don’t think i’ve seen any of the movies since 2011. and then the theater i work at decided to show two of the movies each sunday for a month long
this was one of the most enjoyable experiences i’ve ever had at the theater, and i’d seen all 8 movies in theaters the first time around. i cried a lot too: harry and hagrid entering diagon alley, the hogwarts express winding it’s way through the hills. harry longingly gazing at his parents in the mirror of erised. this particular movie i used to watch every day. it was the first dvd i’ve ever owned, and i would play it on repeat on my family’s old windows 98 computer. it’s so burned into my brain that i still know every word
i’m just so happy i got to see this in theaters again, after some years of healthy distance from the biggest obsession i’ve ever had. now i can love it as an adult too, in a different way. and seeing it with my dad made it even better, because we’ve bonded over this series together every step of the way, since the night i asked him to read me the first book. maybe it’s cheesy to say now, but there will always be a place in my heart for harry potter",True,0.041,0.856,0.103,0.9819

Eighth Grade,4.5,"“stay cool, and i can’t wait to be you”
i’ve said it for years: loneliness is underrated. showing it on screen is really tricky territory, it’s either too dull or too dark. and in almost every coming of age film, the protagonist has a best friend, or even a big group of them, close knit and finishing each other’s sentences. but what about all the kids who didn’t have that? the ones that try for years just to make a connection, who can’t help but obsess about it. why don’t people like me? am i not trying hard enough? what could i say? what could i do? a lot of the time it isn’t anyone’s fault at all. it’s just how things are right now
this is such an eye opening experience in such a specific way. simplistically and stylistically interesting and yet leaves a lot of room to explore deeper if seen by the right person: the future and how we long for it, long to be different and better forms of ourselves. it’s a natural human feeling that we carry with us always. caught in between the past and the present, and trying to be someone that will take years to become
and visually this KILLS me, the camerawork is so effortlessly cool. so much of it is so satisfyingly pieced together. bo makes it look easy. kayla’s journey is awkward, but the film’s style is anything but. there is still one scene that really bothers me (you know the scene), and i can’t personally enjoy or fully understand it’s inclusion in the film, but i decided against writing up a few paragraphs arguing it: it feels unnecessary to me, but they tried to handle the subject carefully so i’m gonna try to let it go. for now
the real reason i love this film is that it’s a voice for the unheard. there were a lot of days in middle school that i barely spoke to anyone, and no one spoke to me either: that’s just the way it was for me then. and this reminded me that i got through it. and thank god for that",True,0.071,0.791,0.139,0.9806

as mainstream a thriller as you would find in 2002, but just as stylish as anything fincher had made up until then. i personally think this is overlooked for how effectively it works within the walls of a single location, and the “cutting edge” and slightly goofy cgi just make it more fun. oh, and casting jodie and kristen as mother and daughter makes this an lgbt film, i don’t make the rules",True,0.014,0.87,0.117,0.8686

A Wrinkle in Time,2.0,"it means well. this has a pulsating heart, beating deep beneath miles of mess. i can feel it, the movie itself constantly reminds me it’s there, but sometimes that isn’t enough
the headlining actors make this a painless and sometimes joyful ride, and the child actors do bring charm to round out the cast, but the script is incredibly weak, and the plot is even weaker. and people claim that interstellar doesn’t make sense..... the visuals do heighten the experience, it’s clear that ava had a distinct eye for what she wanted, and she goes for it: the colors are saturated and welcoming, a lot of the camera movements are crisp and deliberate. if only they served a bigger purpose. in the end, they go to waste in this muddled wasteland of a movie
now that i have my opinion out of the way, let’s try this from a different angle: this is very obviously a family movie, a children’s movie. and while it would be ideal that all family movies have a certain universal quality to them (especially in the eyes of the filmmakers), not all of them land that mark. but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have worth. especially in this case, directed by a black woman, starring a young black girl. this means something, you’re probably tired of reading that, but it does 
and even without addressing that specifically, this is still a vision from the right set of innocent eyes. i saw this tonight with my best friend since early childhood. we went through countless shared obsessions with movies as kids, and most of those movies were just awful. at one point while watching this, i compared it in my head to sharkboy and lavagirl, and not even negatively. because we liked that movie as kids, and many others like it. because as a child, different things matter. if it strikes a chord, you’re hooked. that all consuming dedication to a movie that your parents just chuckle at, but you couldn’t love more. my friend and i even agreed that if we’d seen this together 15 years ago, we would have fallen in love with it. and we loved and respected that. and the biggest thing i took away from this, is that it’s most definitely going to be one of those movies for many kids. they don’t have letterboxd accounts, they don’t know what reviews are or how to use the rating system, but they’re going to sit in front of their tvs and click play over and over and over again, letting themselves be immersed in that special kind of childhood magic that movies bring into your life. and that’s where this movie succeeds. it has nothing to do with me, or us. it’s bigger than that. no critic or rating could ever touch that",True,0.057,0.756,0.188,0.9975

caring about someone is such a risk, and yet we do it every day. to let someone know you, to almost give them a part of you just to get to know them. to care so much it hurts, it tears you up. to feel physically ill. that part of you was entrusted to someone else and now it’s being crushed into dust. it’s the kind of experience we almost all have throughout our lives, and it was cathartic for me to see it shown here
jacob, i know this was a personal one for you. but i just want you to know, it paid off: this is definitely the best film you’ve ever put together. everyone involved should be proud, it’s an accomplishment in my eyes. and thank you for involving me, it means a lot to me every time i can help you with your projects even in the slightest. and thank you for the title card. advising editor has a really nice ring to it, and you know it means a lot to me. i’m really proud of you and i can’t wait to come back to LA so we can waste a whole day driving around the city in your prius listening to lorde

passion is underrated. we do what we have to, we help those around us. we do what we have to to get by. every day can be a struggle when you're living a life you don't want to. even if you don't realize that it's not what you want
finding people that share your same passions is one of the most important kinds of relationships in life. what's even more, is finding someone that doesn't share your exact passion, but will listen to what you have to say. spill your guts: gush about what you love, at length and in great detail. what do you love? why do you love it? if someone will listen, if they want to listen, even if they can't relate or don't need to know, that's an important kind of bond
i was born and raised in a town like columbus. i still live here, even though i'd love to pull a lady bird and fly away on the next flight out to some far away city. it isn't such a bad place, it just isn't where i should be right now. the last year i've grown more than i have in my life, in more ways than one. and the biggest thing i've been contemplating recently is the desire to follow what i'm passionate about. and it isn't just a place, it's people. people who share the same passion i do, people who will listen. in my case, it's film. i work at a movie theater and i discuss films all day long, with coworkers and customers, but it always feels off. like we're not on the same wavelength. that doesn't make our relationships and friendships lesser or not worthy. it just isn't the same as being around people who feel what i feel
going out into the great unknown to discover more about what you love is one of the scariest things you could do. leaving loved ones behind is one of the most heartbreaking things to even consider doing. this movie makes me cry, because the ending is a personal kind of dream of mine, and the tenderness of it is overwhelming
kogonada captures a feeling with this piece of film that is completely unique. passion, understanding, calm. this is a really special movie, but not just because of the cinematography or performances. it's special to me because it touched me. feeling that way is one of the most important feelings when watching any movie, and how you feel shapes your entire opinion of it. this truly ended up being my special movie of the year. i hope you all have one too
thanks for letting me spill my guts about what i'm passionate about. i appreciate you listening. now i'm gonna go edit this movie into my 2017 in film video, which should be up within the week. i can't wait to show you all what i've been passionate about this year",True,0.034,0.717,0.249,0.9993

this short is creative and genuine, just like all of jacob's previous films and like jacob himself. i've always been so impressed with how he throws these together, even though i know how much care he puts into every project. being his friend the past few years has been a joy, and i jump at the chance to show support, be involved in or help with his films in any way that i can. i have no doubt that they will continuously get better and i can't wait to see what else he has in store. thanks for another shout out in the credits, jacob!!! 💕 (and the last shot in this film is maybe my favorite thing you've filmed yet)",True,0.019,0.77,0.211,0.9926

Titanic,5.0,"this morning right before i woke up, i had a dream right at the edge of consciousness. all it involved was me remembering and thinking about the movie titanic and saying to myself 'mom and i haven't watched this in a while. we should rewatch it together soon.' it wasn't until i woke up that i realized that my mom passed away 2 years ago.
titanic is, by far, the most nostalgic movie for me. it's 100% pure concentrated nostalgia. every line of dialogue and sound effect and song is burned into my brain, recalling the 50+ times i used to watch it with my mom when i was really young. she was big on movies, especially rewatching them. she rewatched her favorite movies hundreds of times, never tiring of them. she'd invite my brother and i to watch them with her whenever we were interested, no matter how young we were. she was the one who introduced me to kill bill volume 1 when i was only 10 years old and i fell in love with it. there were others we'd start to watch again and again together: selena, signs, girl interrupted, simon birch. dozens of them. she wasn't always great at spending time with me, telling me to watch tv in a different room while she watched her own tv, so movies were an easy common ground. titanic was one of the earliest and by far the biggest deal of any of the movies we watched, and that's saying something because we used to make tin hats out of aluminum foil when we watched signs.
she had the double vhs tapes, the ones i just rewatched. she'd pack them in our bags when we'd go to a chicago children's hospital hours and hours away from home so i could have surgery. she'd start the first tape every night as we settled down in the hospital room, the nurses coming in every once in a while to check on me and glancing at the tv. 'oh! titanic!' they'd say. my mom liked the volume loud. she didn't stop it or turn it down if i fell asleep, and i started to fall asleep almost immediately after it began. so the audio pierced through my dreams many times as i slept, and now it's like an echo in my head whenever i watch it.
this isn't a review as much as a memory i wanted to write out and might as well share, for anyone who cares. titanic is a great movie, but it doesn't matter to me how great it is, because it'll always be one of the purest ways i was connected to my mom. i probably haven't seen it since 2012 when we went to the theater together for the re-release. after she passed, i thought i might not be able to watch it for years, and maybe never again. but here i am. sometimes all you need is to carve out 4 hours to rewatch titanic and have a good cry. or at least i do.",True,0.024,0.909,0.067,0.9586
