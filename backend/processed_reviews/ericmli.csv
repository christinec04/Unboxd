Midsommar,2.5,"It’s fine. It’s Sweden.
Haziness
The prolonged static shots and disorienting hazy visuals create the unsettling, dream-like aesthetic and convey the characters' drug-induced states. The vibrant flowers/background pop against the characters' white outfits. At one point, my sister was practicing Chopin’s Valse to Madame the Countess Delphine Potocka downstairs, adding an unexpected ambiance and tricked my friends and me into thinking it was part of the soundtrack.
Bruh Moments 
If Ari Aster did not direct Midsommar, I’m not sure its reputation would hold the same status. Similar in Hereditary, Aster likes to involve family tragedy, which he does much better in Hereditary. There are notable easter eggs that display trauma, but those are really the only moments it’s shown. The connection between the friend group that goes to Sweden together is lackluster-ed too. The unsettling scenes, specifically one at the climax, are more so “bruh moments” in the sense of turning to your friends and commenting on the ridiculousness. I will give credit where it’s due to some lore-specific horror scenes.

Tokyo Godfathers,4.5,"God must be busy at this time of year.
Pilgrimage
Tokyo Godfathers offers an original composition of principal characters: a middle-aged alcoholic, runaway teen, former drag queen, and abandoned newborn. All compelled by the helpless life of a baby, the three homeless strangers set on a pilgrimage toward their own redemption. Can things that are broken still be fixed? What follows is an endless string of seemingly impossible coincidences that can only be labeled as divine intervention.

Magnolia,2.5,"This cannot be one of those things.
Duration
The opening, with its philosophical setup on fate and chance, set a pretty high bar that the film's narrative couldn't clear in the end. The promise of profound coincidences in Magnolia evaporated over its runtime; my friends and I want our 3 hours back.
Dialogue
The individual character arcs were sometimes amusing, specifically the relationship between the Christian cop and emotionally-damaged woman, as well as the ""Seduce and Destroy"" guy. Even in these moments, the film relied on exposition-heavy dialogue to force the 'profundity' of each 'original,' but bland experience, turning our viewing experience into a listening exercise. There were a lot of facepalm scenes.
Alienation
When the six of us had to deliberately watch YouTube videos to understand the 'deeper meaning,' our sentiment shifted from puzzled curiosity to shared frustration. Magnolia's narrow focus on the anxieties of the predominantly white, suburban experience in the late 90s and early 2000s alienated us. None of us were white or conscious during that time period.

American Psycho,2.5,"Eggshell with Romalian type.
Satire
Christian Bale describes American Psycho as ""brilliant, but farcical on many levels"" in an interview. While the satirical humor was enjoyable in select scenes, such as the business card exchange, I didn't find the brilliance that accompanied the dark humor of sex and murder all that appealing. As a director, Mary Harron's goal to ridicule the average Wall Street businessman and social system of 1980s New York City was successful; however, I didn't have as much fun as I thought I would have watching it. Hate-watching just isn't my forte. The disturbing lack of diversity in the West at that time is a realistic touch that can be appreciated.

Christian Bale's American accent was surprisingly soothing. American Psycho's reputation would be saved if some enjoyers stopped idolizing the main character.",True,0.134,0.651,0.215,0.931
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),3.0,"You never know the particulars.
Flow
Birdman feels as if it was filmed all in one continuous shot. The jazz drums scores, camera pans, and one-on-one dialogue transition well from scene to scene, but the heavy use of this formula isn't necessarily engaging for having friends over, especially when one of them falls asleep.
Introspection
Birdman's pursuit of past glory deepens his conflicting self-perception, setting up a final sequence that is hard to label. This narrative choice is the opposite of lazy, emphasizing the summation of existential themes and effort placed into filming Birdman.

The Fifth Element,3.5,"Follies, lollies, and lick-them-lollies.
Chris Tucker
Chris Tucker's role as a flamboyant radio host is the sole reason why he should be the sixth element. The slower pacing in the first-half of The Fifth Element is made up for by the fashion icon in a leopard print suit with a cannon design for his hair.
Panache
The science fantasy tone is well-complemented by its villain designs, such as one antagonist's asymmetrical plastic headpiece and slicked-back hair. An opera scene accompanied by an action sequence was definitely random, but also cohesive. Apparently, that opera song is one of the most difficult in the world to sing.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1,5.0,"100 men vs. 1 Uma Thurman
Fusion
The contrasting blend of monochrome, anime, and vibrant color grading define Kill Bill's visual identity. The 8 minute anime sequence reminded me of Samurai Champloo. The similarity in sharp and rough animation is not just a coincidence; Kazuto Nakazawa, the director of the animation segment, also served as the character designer and chief animation director for Samurai Champloo. Since Samurai Champloo is my favorite anime, I can't help but be biased.
Heterogeneity
Kill Bill's ensemble of diverse female characters distinguishes itself. Lucy Liu's performance as a Japanese-Chinese-American pretty much sums up the diversity. Chiaki Kuriyama's performance as a psychotic schoolgirl-bodyguard stood out the most, elevating the adrenaline of all the blood spill. While the composition of the cast offered dynamic relationships, there was a lack of backstory, with the exception of an antagonist.
Other
The rizz sound effect is from Kill Bill?? I was NOT expecting a close-up of Uma Thurman's dogs. This was my first time watching a Quentin Tarantino film, so I had no clue about the running gag between Tarantino and feet. While that caught me off-guard, I was a fan of the back-of-the-heel shots (with shoes on) scattered throughout Kill Bill.",True,0.166,0.772,0.061,-0.9824
